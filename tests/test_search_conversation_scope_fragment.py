"""Every public.conversations read in the search reader carries the scope fragment.

A new join that forgets it would show Business chats in Personal search, or the
reverse. The test reads the module source, lists each occurrence and fails on
the first one whose own join condition (or, for the one ``from``, whose own
``where``) lacks the fragment.

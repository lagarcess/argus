"""Guard for the research-job activity migration.

The settle rule has one owner, ``argus.domain.job_settlement``. The SQL
function in this migration is rendered from it, so the checked-in text must be
exactly that rendering, and every activity reader must derive from the
function rather than restating the rule. The callers are pinned at the body
level: each replaced function must be the original migration's body with the
inline predicate swapped for the owner call (and, for the batch read, the
predicate hoisted into one CTE), so a body-level revert cannot hide behind an
unchanged signature.

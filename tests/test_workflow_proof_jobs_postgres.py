"""A Render workflow proof job is not conversation activity, on real Postgres.

The seeder writes the proof's scope and no conversation, so every activity
reader, which joins jobs to a conversation, cannot see it. A row the seeder
wrote before this contract (the column default made it a chat job) projects
``checking`` until the migration's reclassification statement moves it; the
statement is executed here as checked in.

Set ``ARGUS_DISPOSABLE_DATABASE_URL`` only to an isolated Supabase Postgres
database with all checked-in migrations applied.

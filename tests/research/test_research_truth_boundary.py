"""The truth boundary, with the same standing as the S10 memory lock.

Research informs the reader; Argus providers execute the simulation. These
locks prove no finance_search number can reach a backtest:

1. A research stage patch may only carry prose, sidecars, and rows; it can
   never write strategy, confirmation, or execution state.
2. A test launched from a research answer re-grounds through Argus market
   data: a sentinel price planted in the provider packet appears nowhere in
   the confirmation payload, whose figures come from the provider fixture.
3. The research domain package never imports the engine or backtest stack,
   and the engine-launch stack never imports research (source-level scan,
   same mechanism as tests/test_spine_guardrails.py).

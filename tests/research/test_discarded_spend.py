"""Spend locks (#569): a turn records what it paid, whatever it published.

The rail can pay a provider and publish none of what came back: a claim that
retrieved no public publisher, a retry the turn preferred not to keep, an
answer that could not be read. Every one of those used to reach the cost
ledger as zero. These tests hold the line in both directions, that a discarded
response is still billed and that a reader is never shown what it cost.

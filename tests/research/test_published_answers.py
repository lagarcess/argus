"""A retrieved answer publishes: one owner at the composition seam.

PR #562 withheld a whole answer whenever one typed row cited a page the
response had not retrieved, or a typed answer wrote no row. Perplexity's
finance tool answers a price with its own page as the source, the model often
cites a different plausible page instead, and every such quote was paid for
and thrown away. These locks pin the reverse: a row keeps the citation the
model wrote, a figure written with no citation is named under the answer, the
answer itself is never withheld for a row, and the only withholding left is a
turn that retrieved nothing (#580) or a survey that names nothing the resolver
verifies.

"""Research sends the asking user's country as the location, on both paths.

A country is a declared profile setting. A research request built for a user
with one carries it as the web search's ``user_location``; a request built for
a user with none carries no location. Every request here is recorded by a
transport that answers from canned documents, so no provider is called.

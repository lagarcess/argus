"""The documented research sidecar has to be the one the runtime emits.

The example in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` declared `sources` as an array of URL
strings long after the runtime started emitting typed source objects. Prose
two sections below described the object shape correctly, so the contract was
right in one place and wrong in another, and a client generated from the
example would reject every real payload.

String assertions over the document are what let that happen: they check the
words, never the shape. These parse the canonical example and hold it against
the runtime's own models and its own key set instead.

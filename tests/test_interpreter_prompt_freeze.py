"""The text the interpretation model reads is frozen against measured evidence.

Unit tests never send a message through a model, so a prompt edit passes every
gate in CI and only surfaces in the paid live eval after the merge. PR #491
rewrote the shared prompt for a DCA change and silently broke asset extraction,
date preservation, and discovery routing in three unrelated places.

Changing this surface therefore requires re-measuring it, and this test is what
forces the scorecard to exist.

This is the shared instruction text and response schema every interpreted turn
passes through, so a change here can move behavior far from the lane that made
it. To land one:

  1. Run the live measurement eval on the branch.
  2. Commit its scorecard under docs/reports/evidence/.
  3. Compare it against the scorecard named in {FINGERPRINT_PATH} and confirm no
     case regressed.
  4. Regenerate the fingerprint and point last_measured at the new scorecard.

If you did not intend to touch model-facing text, revert instead.

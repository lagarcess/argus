"""Every cookie Argus actually writes must be a disclosed cookie.

Two independent checks, because either alone is escapable:

* The chokepoint is the single place cookies are written, so there is one
  place to read to know what Argus sets. It reports an unregistered name
  rather than raising: a stale disclosure must never break a live request.
* The observation test patches ``Response.set_cookie`` on the class itself and
  exercises the real auth surface, so it records what was genuinely written no
  matter which name the calling code used to reach the method. Aliasing,
  wrappers, and dynamic names are all covered because this watches behaviour
  rather than syntax.

The observation test is bounded by the routes it exercises. That bound is the
honest limit of this file and is why the chokepoint exists as well.

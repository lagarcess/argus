"""Guard for the decision attachment migration.

The DecisionNote validator and the table constraints state one rule: a row
attaches to exactly one of an evidence artifact or a stored computation, and
the idea lineage travels with the artifact. This pins the migration text to
that rule and to its promotion classification, so a rewrite cannot quietly
widen it into a data rewrite.

"""Guard for the workflow-proof scope migration.

Every ``operation_scope`` value has one owner, ``argus.domain.backtest_job_scopes``;
the migration's check constraint is rendered from it and must be exactly that
rendering. The seeder owns the proof's created_by signature and the
reclassification is keyed on it. The settle rule itself is untouched: this
migration must not restate or replace the owner function.

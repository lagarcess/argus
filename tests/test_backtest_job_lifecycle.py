"""The two sides of the consumption design cannot disagree.

One module states when a job may still succeed; the card-restore filter
and both success-write guards derive from it. These tests walk every job
state the database allows, plus shapes it does not, and assert the
derivations never diverge: no state may both give the card back and later
convert into a result.

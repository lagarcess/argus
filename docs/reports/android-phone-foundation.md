# Android phone foundation acceptance

Development-only Kotlin/Compose shell; no production-auth or financial-runtime
readiness claim. See [setup](../../mobile/android/README.md) and the
[bounded lane spec](../superpowers/specs/2026-09-28-android-phone-foundation.md).

## Provenance and ownership

- Original integration base: `3b9313f3dcf80e3ff9eddfcce8818a829a081225`.
- Spec-first commit: `c5a1c644`.
- Implementation design reference: #727 `e29ee6f930a58d0eeca4ca49b2545a3cb63a1d43`.
- Later design readback: `802b82306cc29373d7e4dce44c17d33adb243e30`, still open.
  Its only intervening change limits the recording-lane handoff to contract work;
  archive, shell and design tokens are unchanged. No reference branch was merged.
- Design ZIP hash: `c55e565aa142e38eec61b570510af1c4c2cb9629c24f3ce2d01387639f0ea0e6`.
- iPhone lane #729 confirmed the same tab order and no networking/auth/domain
  rules; only appearance persists. Its files and canonical docs were untouched.
- #726 coordination request: [handoff comment](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/pull/726#issuecomment-5876433004).
  Observed probe head `de61fd3e7d299fcd0c7fda24f3c95f5427822271`.
  Owner handoff remains pending; no probe compile/test result is claimed yet.

## Environment

Apple Silicon arm64, Android Studio 2026.1.4 build
`AI-261.26222.65.2614.16379836`, bundled JBR 25.0.3. Android Emulator 37.1.11.
AGP 9.1.1, Gradle 9.3.1 with verified distribution hash, Kotlin 2.2.10, Compose
BOM 2025.08.01, SDK/target API 36 and build-tools 36.0.0. ARM64 Google APIs API
36 image. Dedicated devices: Pixel 4 at 1080×2280/480dpi (360dp wide), Pixel 7
Pro at 1440×3120/560dpi (approximately 411dp wide).

Official compatibility sources:
[AGP](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/agp-9-1-0-release-notes),
[Gradle/JVM](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/compatibility.html).
Lint retains warnings-as-errors, excluding only rolling upgrade notices
`OldTargetApi`, `AndroidGradlePluginVersion`, and `GradleDependency`; the lane
intentionally pins this verified API/toolchain instead of automatically upgrading.

## Acceptance record

The app source at `8fe35fd32abf0c27ffbc08312db082a4478ba964` passed build,
3 JVM tests, lint, and all 9 instrumented tests on both API 36 phones. The full
9-test suite also passed on each phone in es-419 at 130% font size (36 passing
checks across the four configurations). Tests cover five ordered accessible
48dp tab targets, registration notices for direct and chat actions, disconnected
finance input, native Back, settings origin, all appearance choices across
activity recreation, and live System appearance changes.

Manual small-phone checks confirmed Dark survives force-stop/relaunch, the
keyboard hides bottom navigation, and Back dismisses it while preserving the
sample draft. Appearance was restored to System. Screenshots were inspected
for the compact phone, large phone and enlarged Spanish text. This is basic
semantics/layout coverage, not a TalkBack certification.

[Durable device evidence](evidence/android-phone-foundation/README.md) contains
raw captures, instrumentation outputs and a source-tree manifest. English tab
captures were taken after settling ripple animations. Evidence-only changes
must be explicitly revalidated against the recorded app source tree at closeout.

The Android PR workflow at this source head passed. A duplicate push run failed
fetching several Maven artifacts while the PR run succeeded with the same
source; this is recorded as an infrastructure failure, not a passing run.
Final-head CI and remote Codex review are recorded in the PR closeout.

Codex review of `af6e27392b65da14778ff54ab95090d320451dab` found one
confirmed issue: ordinary activity recreation discarded the sample draft.
`2df05cd88725b1d00160bdc111c651ed650a0e03` uses Android saved UI state for the
draft. The existing disconnected-input test now recreates the activity before
checking the draft. Build, 3 JVM tests, lint and 9/9 tests on each phone pass.
English screenshots were refreshed. Unchanged Spanish rendering, appearance
persistence and IME/Back evidence is explicitly retained by the source diff.

The required mocked backend harness was attempted once locally. Collection
failed in `scipy.linalg` importing `_spropack` with the Mach-O `__thread_bss`
zero-fill-section error. It did not execute and is not reported as passing.
No runtime code changed; repository CI is the remaining backend gate.

## Limits

- This sample app has no network permission. Composer input never dispatches a
  turn. Sample actions demonstrate registration boundaries, not server enforcement.
- Financial displays are localized fixtures, not financial calculations, records
  or API models. Only appearance uses preference storage; the sample draft uses
  Android saved UI state. Settings cannot save product data.
- Active conversations, full temporary-chat behavior, voice, attachments, sharing,
  account setup and ecosystem writes are explicitly unavailable.
- Native navigation uses a floating tonal surface and Android ripple; no claim of
  platform backdrop-blur parity. Motion is instantaneous, so reduced-motion users
  receive no custom motion. System component animations follow Android settings.
- API 26 is the configured minimum, not a tested older-device promise. Physical
  phones, TalkBack, production lifecycle, signing and publishing remain unverified.
- No production URLs/keys, hosted configuration, paid calls, merge or deploy.

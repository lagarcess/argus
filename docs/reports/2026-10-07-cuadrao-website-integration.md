# Cuadrao website integration record

PR [#884](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/pull/884) contains the October 7 founder-authorized website delivery to `codex/private-alpha-next`. Its terminal PR comment records the final reviewed head, merge SHA, review verdict and exact-head CI. This record travels with the same PR so branch protection applies to the documentation as well as the code.

## Outcome and boundaries

English and Spanish Business, Personal and contact pages preserve the approved presentation. Fictional examples explain money, plans, capture, assistant proposals, search, updates, personal/business separation and customer payments. The [coverage matrix](evidence/cuadrao-owner-vision/coverage.md) maps the source vision to the page and explains exclusions.

The site remains default-off through `CUADRAO_WEBSITE_PREVIEW=false` in the tracked web environment template. Preview pages remain noindex. Contact prepares a local review only. Personal signup returns HTTP 503 without storage or messages; the previous local SQLite experiment is not part of the delivered code. No new database, dependency or middleware service is introduced.

The independent review found a pre-hydration native form GET that could put a Personal email address in the URL. The fix follows the existing contact form's hydration guard and uses an explicit POST target. A real-browser regression covers both languages with JavaScript disabled and verifies retained input after the actual unavailable response.

## Lineage and evidence

- Original and pre-review integration base: `ad7eb9ccb8261456d12ce5a26686682bbce9ae2f`.
- Integration was an ancestor of the candidate. No reconciliation merge or intervening semantic overlap was present at review start. The terminal PR comment records the final pre-merge refresh.
- [Production browser evidence](evidence/cuadrao-integration-delivery/README.md) records the verified source tree, responsive layouts, form states, metadata, route gates and shared app checks.
- Independent review compares the actual parent and candidate browser surfaces, including enabled Spanish preferences and a synthetic public receipt without JavaScript. Its PR verdict is required before merge.
- Parent verification includes frontend tests, lint, production build/TypeScript, focused browser tests, modularity budget and changed-document links. GitHub CI and local smoke must be terminal and passing before merge.

## Remaining work

The public launch parent [#880](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/880) remains open for domain/routing, indexing, privacy and hosted acceptance. [#881](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/881) owns actual Business inquiry delivery. [#882](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/882) owns durable Personal signup through the existing Supabase infrastructure and notification/removal operations. Preserve any real earlier local registrations through separately reviewed handling; this delivery does not inspect or migrate a signup database.

These follow-ups are not closed by #884. The existing financial APIs, native app, model instructions, hosted configuration and deployments are outside this delivery.

## Landing procedure

After GitHub confirms the merge, fast-forward the clean canonical integration checkout, verify merge-tree parity, reconcile the three open issues and wait for exact-head integration CI and smoke. Record that outcome on #884. No documentation-only direct push or protection bypass is required because the execution and integration ledgers are included in the reviewed PR.

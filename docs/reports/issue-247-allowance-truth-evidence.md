# Issue #247 — Allowance Truth Evidence

Implementation lane: `codex/issue-247-allowance-truth`.
Base: PR #259 head `9752825c` merged with integration `7d92fb40`
(`origin/codex/private-alpha-next`) at `8899dc7c`.

This report records the local implementation and verification evidence for
the truthful Usage limits and allowance accounting slice. Live production-
parity browser QA status is recorded in the final section; deterministic
green alone is not completion.

## Current-state impact map (before this lane)

- Chat messages were charged at route entry in `chat_stream`
  (`check_and_increment_usage_limits` before conversation lookup and runtime
  work), so an Argus infrastructure failure consumed a message unit and both
  windows were charged whether or not any durable terminal response existed.
- Direct `POST /backtests/run` charged `backtest_runs` between the provider
  preflight and execution through Python count-then-increment under a
  process-local `threading.Lock`; replay was an in-process dictionary; no
  durable job existed on that path.
- Chat-launched simulations charged nothing: the shadow-job path applied
  count-then-insert concurrency backpressure only, and on backpressure it
  silently skipped the durable job and executed in-process anyway.
- `GET /me/usage` returned the daily messages window only and deliberately
  hid simulations.
- No `chat_turn_lifecycles` table exists (#240 open). The durable terminal
  boundary for ordinary turns is terminal assistant persistence through the
  serialized `append_conversation_message` function
  (`20260717000001_serialize_conversation_message_append.sql`).
- No atomic admission function existed (#230 open); `create_backtest_job`
  resolved idempotency by select-then-insert.
- Quota limits were duplicated as inline literals at every call site.

## Implemented boundaries

### Message accounting (settle at durable terminal outcome)

- Route entry performs a non-consuming hour+day check
  (`argus.api.chat.allowance.check_message_allowance`) and still returns 429
  when a window is exhausted. Run actions skip the message check.
- Exactly one message unit settles atomically with the first durable insert
  of the turn's terminal product message through
  `public.append_conversation_message_settling_usage`
  (`20260722000001_settle_message_allowance.sql`): it delegates to the
  serialized append boundary and, only when the append durably inserted a
  new row (not a replay), upserts the hour and day `usage_counters` rows in
  the same transaction.
- Settlement call sites: the main runtime terminal persist, the two
  onboarding clarification/follow-up persists, and the cancel-confirmation
  acknowledgment. Failure-guard persists (`agent_runtime_turn.status =
  "failed"`), the missing-confirmation-checkpoint recovery persist, and
  suppressed late artifacts settle nothing.
- `chat.run_backtest` turns settle no message unit; their allowance is the
  simulation charge at durable admission.
- Memory mode mirrors settlement through `AlphaStore.usage_counters`.

### Simulation accounting (charge at unique durable admission)

- `public.admit_backtest_job`
  (`20260722000002_atomic_backtest_admission.sql`) resolves, under one
  advisory transaction lock, in the approved order: exact replay or identity
  collision; hour and day allowance exhaustion; per-user capacity; global
  capacity; then inserts the durable job and charges both windows in the
  same transaction. Limits arrive as required parameters from the one
  backend policy module (`argus.domain.usage_limits`).
- Chat run actions route through the same operation
  (`argus.api.chat.backtest_admission_flow`); an unadmitted run returns a
  typed rejection envelope (`simulation_allowance_exhausted`,
  `backtest_capacity_exceeded`, `idempotency_conflict`) through the existing
  execute-stage failure contract instead of executing for free.
- Direct `POST /backtests/run` resolves an existing reservation before
  quota, preflight, or compute; keeps the contractual non-consuming
  allowance precheck ahead of the provider preflight (coverage rejection
  still consumes zero); admits as `running` after preflight; finishes as a
  durable terminal job on success and failure; and replays return prior
  durable truth (`200` run, `409 idempotency_in_progress`, or the terminal
  failure) without charging. The in-process idempotency dictionary is no
  longer used in durable mode.
- `argus.domain.backtest_admission` provides the approved #229 canonical
  identity serializer, key validation, direct-payload materialization, and a
  deterministic in-process twin for memory mode.

### Read contract

- `GET /me/usage` returns, for `messages` and `backtests`, both active UTC
  windows (`limit`, `used`, `remaining`, exact `period_end`) plus
  backend-derived `available_now` and `limiting_window` (smaller remaining;
  `day` on ties). Missing rows read zero without creating counters. `used`
  may truthfully exceed `limit` after concurrent settlements; `remaining`
  clamps at zero. Documented in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` and
  `docs/api/openapi.yaml`.

### Settings → Usage UI

- The Usage panel renders messages and simulations from the backend response
  only: the daily window is the primary story per card, and the hourly
  window appears exactly when the backend marks it limiting. States:
  loading, error+retry, zero, active, hourly-limited, daily-exhausted.
  EN and es-419 localized, including what consumes each allowance. Focus
  trap, Escape, focus restoration, flat styling, and 44px controls
  preserved. No quota constant or reset computation exists in the frontend.

## Donor extraction ledger

| Donor surface | Decision | Current-base evidence | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `84fc0d6` migration `admit_backtest_job` | Adapt | select-then-insert in `create_backtest_job`; no durable direct-path job | Extended to check and charge hour+day windows; UTC pinned; limits required parameters (no literals in SQL) |
| `84fc0d6` `backtest_admission.py` | Adapt | no counterpart on base | Memory-twin allowance rewired to shared `usage_counters` twin |
| `84fc0d6` direct-route rework | Adapt with reorder | direct replay was process-local; charge preceded durable state | Donor admitted before preflight, which would have made coverage rejection consume a unit; reordered to reservation pre-read → precheck → preflight → admission |
| `84fc0d6` chat flow | Adapt with fix | chat charged nothing; backpressure silently bypassed durable jobs | Donor collapsed rejections to `None`, which fell through to free in-process execution; replaced with typed rejection envelopes |
| `a7238b1` `/me/usage` + reader | Reject shape, reuse patterns | daily-messages-only on base | #247 requires two windows plus `available_now`/`limiting_window`; donor was daily-only |
| `a7238b1` UI/i18n/e2e | Extend in place | #259 material already merged on this branch | Extended to two resources and two windows |
| `29cc1e9` OpenAPI structural gate | Reject | #234 is its own lane | #247 needs only checked-artifact consistency for the touched surface |
| Audit-branch #240 lifecycle train | Reject | `chat_turn_lifecycles` absent on base | Settlement attaches to the existing serialized append boundary; the full lifecycle remains #240 |

## Red-before-fix evidence

`tests/test_allowance_accounting.py` on the untouched base
(commit `74482ed`): 11 failed in 3.95s — entry charge existed, no
settlement seam, no atomic admission (`admit_backtest_job` absent), legacy
increment on the direct route, `/me/usage` daily-messages-only.

Pre-existing baseline finding: `tests/test_modularity_budget.py` was
already red on the untouched branch head because `web/lib/argus-api.ts`
exceeded its budget by 9 lines after the #259 merge; fixed by moving the
usage types onto `web/lib/usage-allowance.ts` (`b31723e`).

Closure-pass red: the dated-direct-request regression test failed with
the production `TypeError: Object of type date is not JSON serializable`
before the `40769aa` fix and passes after; the typed-vs-string-date
identity test was green on both sides, proving the fix changed no
identity.

## Deterministic verification (exact counts, refreshed at the closure pass)

All backend runs hermetic: provider keys blanked,
`ARGUS_MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER_MODE=synthetic_unit_fixture`, Python 3.10.20
(pinned runtime). Counts below were re-run 2026-07-22 at the review-fixed
heads (`f6fb982` and the dated-payload fix `40769aa`); the web tree is
byte-identical across those commits, so the frontend rows hold for the
final SHA.

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Focused backend set (allowance accounting, alpha API memory+supabase, finalization, jobs shadow/async, evidence spine, chat state machine) | 235 passed at `f6fb982`; 155-test focused rerun green after the dated-payload fix |
| Full backend suite `tests/` | 2276 passed, 1 failed (pre-existing, below), 17 skipped at the final-review-round candidate (2273/1/17 at `40769aa`) |
| Disposable-Postgres proofs (`tests/test_allowance_accounting_postgres.py`) | 15 passed; four runs across two fresh containers, including reuse-safety back-to-back runs (skip cleanly without the gate URL) |
| Ruff check + format (`src`, touched tests) | clean |
| Frontend unit suite (`bun test __tests__/`) | 422 passed |
| Frontend lint (`eslint`) | clean |
| Frontend production build (`next build`) | success |
| Playwright usage journeys (mock-auth, Chromium) | 4 passed |
| `git diff --check` | clean |

The one full-suite failure,
`tests/test_backtest_state_machine.py::test_text_approval_uses_llm_turn_act_but_defers_to_card_action`,
is pre-existing at the untouched branch head: `git diff 8899dc7..HEAD`
contains no file on its execution path (the test file, `agent_runtime/`,
and every interpret-stage domain import are byte-identical), and the lane's
clean-checkout baseline is known to carry pre-existing full-suite failures
outside CI's fixed file list. It is not normalized into this lane.

## Disposable-Postgres and ownership evidence

Container: `public.ecr.aws/supabase/postgres:17.6.1.140` (fresh,
disposable; the founder's `supabase_db_argus-qa` stack untouched). All 19
`supabase/migrations` files applied in order with `ON_ERROR_STOP`, zero
errors. Proofs (15 passed):

- settlement charges hour and day exactly once with exact UTC period
  boundaries, replays zero, and rolls back atomically with its message;
- ten barriered concurrent settlements of distinct turns count exactly ten;
- ten barriered same-identity admissions admit once, charge one unit, and
  replay nine times with one durable job;
- ten barriered distinct-identity admissions admit exactly the queued
  capacity (2) and reject the rest with zero extra charge;
- same key with a different identity conflicts without disclosure or
  mutation;
- a legacy null-identity reservation replays on an exact payload match and
  adopts the canonical identity; any other reuse of its key conflicts;
- hourly and daily exhaustion reject before any charge or insert;
- a post-admission failure keeps exactly one unit and its replay returns
  the durable failed job without charging;
- a stale running direct job reconciles to a retryable
  `direct_execution_abandoned` failure on the next admission;
- direct success commits the run/evidence tuple and the succeeded job flip
  in one serialized transaction (`finalize_direct_backtest_success`);
- a reconciled direct job blocks a late success with a SQL null and zero
  committed tuple rows;
- reservations and counters are owner-isolated across users sharing a key;
- the admission and direct-success functions are executable by
  `service_role` only.

## Complexity reassessment

- Added: four forward migrations — the settling append wrapper
  (`20260722000001`), the atomic admission function (`20260722000002`),
  the legacy null-identity replay repair (`20260722000003`), and the
  serialized direct-success finalization (`20260722000004`) — plus one
  policy module extension, one small chat allowance helper, the admission
  domain module with its memory twin, the gateway adapters, and the chat
  admission flow. Each maps to a locked contract requirement (atomic
  charge boundaries, one policy source, typed rejection, one serialized
  success boundary).
- Removed/avoided: the process-local direct-route idempotency map (durable
  mode), the count-then-insert chat backpressure bypass, duplicated limit
  literals across routers, and the donor's full #234 OpenAPI gate and #240
  lifecycle train (out of lane).
- Deliberately not built: billing/entitlement machinery, frontend quota
  logic, background sweepers, GET-path stale reconciliation
  (`GET /backtest-jobs/{id}` reconcile affects staleness visibility, not
  accounting truth; the locked reliability contract expects it on that
  read, so the deferral is an open founder decision recorded in the
  final-review-round section), and quota-specific runtime recovery copy
  (typed codes flow through the existing recovery contract; copy polish
  is a follow-up).

## Remaining risks and rollback boundary

- Chat capacity rejection now surfaces as a typed recoverable failure
  instead of silently executing in-process; the recovery prose is the
  existing generic typed copy, not quota-specific wording.
- Message settlement can overshoot a window by the number of concurrently
  in-flight turns admitted before exhaustion (entry check is non-consuming
  by design); `remaining` clamps at zero and the read surface reports
  truthful `used`.
- Rollback: revert commits per surface — UI (`a052bf5`), read contract
  (`24ee78c`), admission (`5cb80ce`), settlement (`1add789`) — each is
  independently revertible; the migrations are forward-only and preserve
  historical counters and job evidence (reverting callers restores prior
  paths without dropping rows).

## Acceptance matrix (issue #247 checkboxes)

| # | Acceptance item | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Hourly and daily `limit`/`used`/`remaining`/exact `period_end` for messages and simulations | PASS — `tests/test_allowance_accounting.py` window tests; PG proof of exact UTC bounds |
| 2 | Backend-derived `available_now` and limiting-window truth; frontend never computes quota truth | PASS — router derivation tests; frontend source pins reject quota constants and reset math |
| 3 | Normal answers, clarifications, supported/unsupported responses consume one unit at durable terminal completion | PASS — settlement seam tests; PG same-transaction proof; live-proven in both browser passes |
| 4 | Malformed, unauthenticated, abandoned, duplicate-replay, infrastructure-failed turns consume zero | PASS — FastAPI validation/auth reject pre-handler; runtime-failure zero test; replay-zero PG proof; abandoned turns never reach the settling append (generator cancellation precedes terminal persistence) |
| 5 | Committed terminal response + transport disconnect = exactly one unit | PASS (structural) — the charge commits with the terminal message transaction, independent of delivery; disconnect drill remains for live QA |
| 6 | First unique durable admission = one unit | PASS — PG proof |
| 7 | Ten concurrent same-identity requests = one admission, one unit | PASS — barriered PG proof (1 admitted + 9 replay) |
| 8 | Exact replays return durable prior truth, zero additional units | PASS — PG proofs for running/succeeded/failed replay semantics |
| 9 | Pre-admission rejection including #251 preflight = zero | PASS — coverage-rejection and quota-precheck tests unchanged and green; admission runs after preflight |
| 10 | Post-admission execution/finalization failure = one unit + truthful durable terminal job | PASS — PG proof + direct-route failure finalization tests |
| 11 | Direct and chat/workflow launches share the rule | PASS — both routes call the same `admit_backtest_job`; chat rejection envelopes prevent free execution |
| 12 | Settings → Usage enabled, Security preserved, daily-primary + contextual hourly, EN and es-419 | PASS — unit + Playwright journeys; Security page live-rendered in both browser passes |
| 13 | Zero, available, hourly-limited, daily-exhausted, loading, unavailable, reload, keyboard, focus, desktop, mobile states | PASS — unit + Playwright (zero, hourly-limited, exhausted EN/ES, focus trap); live matrix run in both browser passes |
| 14 | Owner isolation and missing-counter behavior on real Postgres | PASS — PG owner-isolation and zero-state proofs; service-role-only function grants |
| 15 | Production-parity local browser QA with real auth proving before/after counters | PASS — two live passes on the isolated local stack: the first functional+presentation pass (first-pass section below) and the exact-head closure pass at `40769aa` (closure section below); the original hosted attempt remains recorded in the historical note |
| 16 | Focused API, migration, concurrency, lifecycle, workflow, frontend, OpenAPI, hermetic gates | PASS — table above |
| 17 | Final diff proportionality: no billing machinery, duplicate counters, frontend quota logic, unrelated refactors | PASS — complexity reassessment above |

## Live product QA — first pass on the isolated local Supabase stack

Executed 2026-07-21 at pre-review-fix heads (functional matrix through
`ac90500`, presentation at `97a552f`) after founder-authorized
configuration; it is presentation and functional evidence for those
commits, not exact-head evidence for the review-fixed candidate (the
closure-pass section below covers that). Hosted Supabase was never
mutated; the connected cloud database predates the required migration
chain (PGRST202 on the serialized append function), so the functional
matrix ran against the local `argus-qa` Docker stack (Kong 54331 /
Postgres 54332), brought forward with the repo migration flow
(`supabase migration up --local`: at that time `20260722000001` and
`20260722000002`; history was a clean prefix). Runtime-only env overrides
isolated both processes to the local stack; the symlinked integration env
files were untouched. The QA identity was a fresh normal local user
(`is_admin = false`) created through real local Supabase Auth signup
(allowlist row seeded locally).

Functional matrix results (sanitized; counters verified in the UI, the
`/me/usage` response, and the local database):

1. Initial truth: zero state read from zero rows; UI matched the server
   JSON exactly (hour end 21:00Z → 4:00 PM CDT, day end 00:00Z → 7:00 PM
   CDT; `available_now` true; `limiting_window` "hour").
2. One completed chat response settled exactly one unit in both windows
   (hour 0→1, day 0→1) and persisted across reload.
3. Injected pre-terminal runtime failure (test-only
   `ARGUS_RUNTIME_EVENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` on the local process) rendered
   the honest recovery message and consumed zero (counters unchanged).
4. The persisted Retry completed and settled one unit for the one
   delivered outcome (no double charge across the failed attempt).
5. Simulation admission (durable-jobs flag on): one run action charged
   hour 0→1 and day 0→1 with one durable `chat.run_backtest` job,
   identity hash, and linked run; the run action itself consumed no
   message unit.
6. Two concurrent same-key run posts (client-derived confirmation key)
   produced one durable job, one linked run, and exactly one unit; a
   same-key different-payload probe returned the non-disclosing conflict
   with zero charge; a post-completion action replay rejected
   pre-admission (`confirmation_required`) with zero charge.
7. Provider preflight rejection (AAPL 1990) returned the honest
   boundary clarification: one message unit, zero simulations.
8. Read purity: an md5 fingerprint over all counter rows (including
   `updated_at`) was identical before and after repeated panel opens,
   closes, reloads, and disclosure toggles; the panel issues GETs only.
9. Genuine hourly exhaustion (controlled local fixture, restored to the
   organic value afterward): rose "limit reached" presentation and a
   429-at-entry send that consumed nothing. Healthy and zero states are
   neutral.
10. Security page fully reachable and rendered in EN and ES.
11. EN and es-419 rendered identical backend truth with locale-correct
    reset formatting; desktop and mobile clean.
12. No 401-after-login occurred on the local stack.

Two live findings were corrected in `ac90500` (rose hourly line at zero
usage; run actions sent random idempotency keys instead of the
confirmation identity, leaving the concurrent-retry window able to
double-admit). Environment gates recorded for rollout: production must
run with `ARGUS_BACKTEST_JOBS_SHADOW_ENABLED=true` (with the flag off,
chat runs take the legacy uncharged in-process path), and the deployed
database must carry the migration chain through `20260722000004`. In
synchronous no-dispatch mode a concurrent replay can re-execute compute
(accounting stays exactly-once; the finalizer dedupes the run identity).

## Approved presentation (Phase B, `28ccdf9`)

The Usage modal is one flat surface: per allowance, backend remaining
capacity leads ("193 left today"), a thin daily bar carries truthful
ARIA values, the reset instant renders through the existing localized
formatter, and hourly capacity is secondary text. Badges, icon tiles,
and repeated explanations were removed; one "What counts?" disclosure
owns both counting rules. Live-verified on real post-matrix counts in
EN/ES, desktop/mobile, dark/light, with zero mutations from panel
interactions. Red-before-fix evidence: the rewritten presentation pins
failed 2/8 against the prior card-based modal (badges present, bordered
tiles, no disclosure) before the implementation turned them green.

## Exact-head closure pass (2026-07-22, `40769aa`)

The review rounds added migrations `20260722000003`/`20260722000004` and
reworked direct admission/finalization after the first live pass, so the
matrix was re-run at the exact candidate on the same isolated local
stack. `supabase migration up --local` applied exactly `20260722000003`
and `20260722000004`; the verified history is the full 19-file chain with
zero pending. The QA identity was the existing local normal user through
real local Supabase Auth (fresh UTC day, so all four windows started from
zero rows).

The pass immediately surfaced a release blocker: every durable-mode
direct `POST /backtests/run` with dates returned 500 at admission —
`BacktestRunRequest` parses dates as Python `date` objects,
`model_dump` keeps them typed, and the PostgREST client cannot
JSON-encode the launch payload. The failure was fail-closed (it preceded
the RPC: zero charge, zero job, zero tuple) and invisible to every
deterministic gate (mock gateways never serialize; the Postgres proofs
serialize string dates). Fixed in `40769aa`: typed dates canonicalize to
ISO day strings in `normalize_direct_launch_payload`, pinned by a
route-level regression whose gateway stub JSON-encodes the payload the
way PostgREST does, with identity proven byte-stable across typed and
string dates (canonical hashing already read dates as ISO).

Matrix results at `40769aa` (counters verified in the UI, the `/me/usage`
response, and the local database at every step; chat/settlement paths are
byte-identical to `f6fb982`, where items 1–4 executed):

1. Three-way zero-state parity: UI "200/60/50/10 remaining" == JSON zeros
   with exact UTC `period_end`s == zero database rows (reads create no
   counters).
2. One completed chat response settled exactly one unit in both windows
   (0→1, 0→1).
3. Injected pre-terminal infrastructure failure
   (`ARGUS_RUNTIME_EVENT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=1` on the local process only)
   rendered the honest recovery and consumed zero; the persisted Retry
   after restoring the clean process settled exactly one unit (1→2) for
   the one delivered outcome.
4. One confirmed chat simulation charged exactly one unit (0→1) with one
   durable succeeded `chat.run_backtest` job and one identity; the run
   action itself consumed no message unit.
5. A dated direct run succeeded (200 with the run in 3.2s) and charged
   exactly one unit (1→2); its exact replay returned the same durable run
   id in 41ms with zero additional charge.
6. Same key with a different payload returned the non-disclosing 409
   `idempotency_conflict` (no payload details in the response) with zero
   charge.
7. Provider preflight rejection (1990 window) returned 422
   `provider_history_start_unavailable` with zero simulations and zero
   messages.
8. Full reload preserved the truthful counts (197/57 messages,
   48/8 simulations).
9. Settings → Security fully rendered (password change and session
   controls).
10. The reconciliation race that cannot be forced safely through a
    browser is proven on real Postgres: the serialized success function
    returns null for a reconciled job and commits zero tuple rows
    (15-proof suite, re-run at `40769aa`).
11. The conversation-less direct job polled with 200,
    `conversation_id: null`, status succeeded, and `result_run_id` linked
    to the exact run the direct call returned.
12. Read purity: the md5 fingerprint over all counter rows (including
    `updated_at`) was identical before and after panel opens, the
    "What counts?" toggle, close, reload, and reopen; the panel issues
    GETs only. The approved disclosure copy rendered verbatim.

## Final-review round (2026-07-22)

Codex's requested final review returned three findings; two were
confirmed and fixed red-first, one awaits a founder decision:

- The chat path never applied the #229 key grammar: the route and the
  admission flow stripped and passed anything non-empty, so padded keys
  aliased the trimmed reservation and malformed keys reached durable
  admission. `/chat/stream` now validates the original header bytes and
  rejects invalid keys with 422 `validation_error` before any work
  (live-verified on the isolated stack: padded, inner-space, and
  oversize keys all 422 with zero charge); the flow validates
  defensively and never normalizes. Valid keys are byte-identical
  through both layers, so no existing reservation changes meaning.
- A duplicate racing the admission that consumed the last allowance
  unit could hit the direct route's non-consuming precheck and receive
  429 before atomic admission could resolve it as a replay (or a
  collision as 409). The exhausted branch now re-reads the reservation
  and, when one exists, resolves it through the atomic admission
  operation — replay serves the durable result, collision returns the
  non-disclosing 409 — before any 429. The reviewer's broader shape
  (always resolving through admission before the 429) was declined: at
  a window rollover it could admit before preflight and charge a
  preflight-rejected request, violating the approved zero-charge rule.
- The pre-existing locked reliability contract says
  `GET /backtest-jobs/{id}` performs owner-scoped stale reconciliation;
  this lane deferred that path to #230/#231 with a passthrough handler.
  The contradiction between the locked contract text and the approved
  lane boundary is recorded as an open founder decision; accounting is
  unaffected either way (the unit is charged exactly once at admission,
  and the same-key replay path already reconciles the stale job).

## Historical note — first hosted attempt

The original live pass was BLOCKED at READY FOR QA CONFIG. `.github/qa.sh` fails closed without a
root `.env` carrying real Supabase/OpenRouter/Alpaca credentials and
`DATABASE_URL`. This worktree has no `.env` and no `web/.env.local`, and
copying credentials from another worktree is out of bounds for this lane.
Once the founder places the approved worktree-local QA configuration, the
prepared session is: `.github/qa.sh` backend, `bun run dev` frontend with
`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_AUTH=false`, founder login, then the 13-step live matrix
(usage panel before/after one completed chat turn, one clarification, one
injected pre-terminal failure, one admission, one replay, one preflight
rejection, reload persistence, EN/ES, desktop/mobile, UTC reset
verification). Hourly-limited and daily-exhausted live states use an
isolated stack only; the disposable proof container recipe is
`docker run -d --rm -p 54999:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=… supabase/postgres
17.6.1.140` plus the migration chain.

# Cuadrao launch reconciliation, October 6, 2026

This record reconciles the consumer launch tracker
[#817](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/817) and its in-scope issues
against what is actually on integration. It is a documentation and GitHub
status audit. It changes no application code, test, migration, workflow,
configuration, flag, hosted system or installed build, and it spends no provider
money. #817 stays open: its finish line is a launch candidate that passes its own
gates, not accurate tracking.

## Source identity

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Integration audited | `codex/private-alpha-next` at `df3882668413e7978d3983adfe1f054cb83595c4` (PR [#873](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/pull/873) housekeeping merge). Integration CI [37414161228](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/actions/runs/37414161228) and smoke [37414161226](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/actions/runs/37414161226) passed at this SHA. |
| Method | Fresh `git fetch origin`; every cited PR's `mergeCommit` read from GitHub and tested with `git merge-base --is-ancestor <mergeCommit> origin/codex/private-alpha-next`. Every checklist item was checked against code or documents at the audited SHA, not only against issue comments. |
| Environment | Repository and GitHub only. No hosted inspection, no simulator, no phone, no local API or database, no provider call. Local, simulator, CI, hosted, provider and phone results are kept separate throughout. |
| Recovery branch | `codex/cuadrao-connected-preview` at `1eca92329c62c012fc789beb3b9c973c49aaaef2`, pushed, not integrated, no PR. |

## Definitions applied

`implemented` means the full issue scope is on integration; a component, a branch
or a reviewed PR alone does not qualify. `verified` means the issue's applicable
acceptance passed with a linked commit, environment and journey evidence.
`enabled` means observed activation for a named environment and audience with
approval; it does not apply to documentation or test-only work. An issue closes
when its own scope and acceptance are complete. No acceptance criterion was
removed, moved or reinterpreted to close an issue. Every SHA below is the real
squash-merge commit, not the reviewed head.

## Result

- Closed issues and their labels are in the [closure table](#closed-by-this-reconciliation).
- No other in-scope issue earns `implemented`, `verified` or `enabled`. Several
  have landed bounded slices (recorded as checked items inside the issue and in
  the table below), but each still has acceptance that no landed evidence
  covers.
- Six product decisions remain open in the Trust ledger. They are the exact
  blockers for #818, #819, #798, #805, #828 and #803. See
  [open decisions](#open-product-decisions).
- #818, the scope matrix, blocks eleven launch issues and has no comment or PR.
  It is the highest-leverage unfinished deliverable.
- Four PRs remain open and each keeps its hold. See [open PRs](#open-pull-requests).

## Closed by this reconciliation

| Issue | Why it closes | Evidence and environment | Labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#676](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/676) password recovery throttle keyed on a spoofable hop | Its only written criterion is met: recovery throttling uses the trusted client IP header, and a test shows a rotated first `X-Forwarded-For` hop does not reset the limit. | PR [#865](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/pull/865), merge `ce7c7350af9a75019a622016ce3a65dbd17e1cc8`. `web/lib/recovery-request.ts` reads only the configured trusted header (default `CF-Connecting-IP`). `web/__tests__/recovery-client-ip.test.ts` returns 429 on the new code and 202 on the old, and integration CI [37414161228](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/actions/runs/37414161228) passed it. Environment is unit tests and CI. Hosted ingress sanitization stays with #686, #694 and #832. A web QA script (`web/e2e/qa-248`) still sets `x-forwarded-for`, which recovery now ignores; this is a note for its owner, not a defect found here. | `implemented`, `verified` |

An independent read-only reviewer tried to refute this closure and a second
proposed one. It confirmed #676 and rejected closing #804, so #804 stays open
below with its remaining criterion.

## Audit table

Merge SHAs are on integration unless marked. "Evidence environment" is the
strongest environment the cited evidence reached.

### Trust, identity and deletion

| Issue | Landed work (merge SHA) | Evidence environment | Exact remaining criterion | Owner or dependency | State and labels |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#800](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/800) sign-in ship gates | Gates 2, 3, 4, 5, 9 done: #844 `a6688eea1`, #857 `7018e0ede`, #864 `5d46a73d4`. Server revocation and admission: #858 `f5c83cd88`, #862 `7c2522fb7`. Name: #869 `927740efd`, #874 `a2c65549b`. Deletion core: #875 `8146d16e9`, cleanup #876 `184d2614e`. Manifest: #849 `5861a8f1b`. | Unit, real local Auth/API/Postgres, simulator. No phone, provider or hosted proof. | Gate 1: no app caller reaches `deleteAccount`, so there is no reachable deletion UI and no app re-prompt for a fresh Apple code; no check couples the client Apple flag to server `ARGUS_APPLE_REVOCATION_CAPTURE_ENABLED`. Gate 6: end to end blocked by gate 1, #805 and #806. Gate 7: web Apple/Google sign-in not built and no recorded exclusion. Gate 8: manifest declares required-reason APIs only; collected-data answers, SDK closure on a signed archive and App Store labels open. Plus real provider and phone proof. | Native identity (the #877 recovery lead wires deletion UI, R3); privacy owner for gate 8; Lucas for the web decision and provider credentials. | Open. No milestone label. |
| [#798](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/798) first sign-in follow-ups | Item 2 (Apple name): server #869, native #874. | Local tests only. Migration is local-only. | Item 1 allowlist orphans: decision between a pre-sign-up hook (`supabase/config.toml` hook is commented out) and scheduled cleanup (runbook records a no-cron decision). Item 3 Hide My Email linking: decision, nothing built. Item 2: real Apple first-authorization proof and hosted migration. | Lucas decision (gate `identity-policy`); backend auth. | Open. No label. |
| [#803](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/803) #802 follow-ups | Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 landed in #858 and #864; item 5 documented. | Unit and local PostgreSQL. | Item 5: accept-and-document or guard the stalled cleanup-revoke race. `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` says acceptance of that recovery policy "remains open in #803". | Lucas decision (gate `apple-late-cleanup`). Recommendation on file: accept and document the forced sign-out recovery. | Open. Body checkboxes ticked for the five landed items. No label. |
| [#804](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/804) #794 follow-ups | #871 `c0d44d399b8fbf2edcdd0a8fd3ad4759a0e9c548` landed six of seven items: entropy-floor test, accurate hex comment, PID-scoped lock-wait test, runbook secret ordering, default-off beta flags in `render.yaml` and the release profile. The `WEB_CONCURRENCY` item is satisfied by the documented gate (`docs/PRIVATE_LAUNCH_RUNBOOK.md`), which the issue allows. | Unit tests and local PostgreSQL. CI skips the real-Postgres tests. | The census item is not met: `tests/test_account_deletion_fk_census_postgres.py` lines 711 to 721 assert hard-coded 3 and 0, and never read the census document, so the document's "Held 3 / Catalog only" rows can go stale without a failure. The test must assert the document's probe cells. That is a test change outside this documentation grant. Hosted secret, destructive migration approval and worker-count readback stay with #830 and #832. | Test owner; backend. | Open. Body checkboxes ticked for six items. No label. |
| [#805](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/805) frozen closed-line balance | Nothing built. #875 and #876 are deletion command and cleanup, not balances. | none | Build the frozen-balance read, the settle command and event, the bilingual copy, and the real-Postgres test. Blocked on the accepted contract: the canonical source of an "open balance with" a member and who may settle it. | Lucas decision (gate `balance-source`); then backend household/planning. | Open. No label. |
| [#806](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/806) PostHog deletion adapter | #847 `70b0cd389`: default-off adapter, durable request tracking, tests with the `persons_found: 0` shape. | Mocked provider and local PostgreSQL. No PostHog call. | Real PostHog request, completion and event readback with a deletion-scoped key; project parity between capture and deletion; Alpha API availability and approval; hosted configuration. A mock proves code behavior only. | Lucas (PostHog access); backend. | Open. `implemented` not earned because the core need is real deletion. |
| [#807](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/807) Lane 6 ops follow-ups | #846 `26c0692d6`: re-seal, fingerprint pin, rollback rotation rule. Item 5 per-worker limit is documented as 6N in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`. #875, #876 partial. | Local PostgreSQL and docs. | Item 3: wire the escalation metric to an alert route or record the daily operator run as the only escalation path. Item 15: name the operator and revisit the no-cron decision. A one-line OpenAPI correction: the 403 text on `src/argus/api/routers/account.py` still says a placeholder, but placeholders get 401. Hosted worker-count readback. | Ops and release; Lucas names the operator. The OpenAPI line is a code change outside this grant. | Open. Body checkboxes ticked for landed items. No label. |
| [#811](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/811) explicit client grants | #837 `f655d131b` migration `20261005090000_explicit_client_grants.sql`, grant-matrix test, CI on pinned and latest CLI. #851 `49add7b0d` latest-CLI resolution. | Local on both CLI images; CI both legs green at the tip. | The CI pin still reads `2.109.0` (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` line 20) and the weekly latest run is inert until the workflow is on `main`, so the fix list's "then move the pin" is not done. Hosted application after the pending migrations, before/after hosted catalog readback, profile-save and job-follow confirmation, behind the migration gate's maintenance review. | CI owner for the pin; Lucas and ops for hosted. | Open. `implemented` not earned strictly (pin). No `verified`. |
| [#856](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/856) Google label at accessibility sizes | #857 changed button appearance only. | Simulator matrix. | The stock `GoogleSignInButton` is unchanged and still clips at Accessibility XXXL in Spanish. Acceptance needs readable complete labels on both entry forms, both languages, light and dark, with the official control retained. | Native identity and accessibility (#800 owner). Revalidate on the recovery branch first (#877). | Open. No label. |
| [#832](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/832) public-launch hardening | #865 `ce7c7350a` (#676); #845 evidence. | See children. | #807 alert and operator; #803 and #804 findings; #671 per-instance limiters (in-process `defaultdict`); #700 chat-turn `Idempotency-Key` replay (syntax check only); #656 raw `months_to_goal` label; #686 and #694 at the promotion that carries #674; #797 census gaps (nothing landed). Each needs its own evidence or an approved applicability decision. | Per child. | Open. No label. |

### Everyday money, home and chat

First chat jobs and memory/voice inclusion are not named. Space-model decisions are not recorded as settled. Customer-work baselines and targets are not recorded per journey. Nine unchecked boxes stay unchecked; two are only partly met. Closure needs one reviewed docs PR adding the matrix, after the founder answers the decisions below. | Captain and docs seat, with Lucas for decisions. Blocks #819, #820, #821, #825, #826, #828, #829, #830, #831, #832, #833. | Open. No label (planning). |

Needs invite intent preservation, waitlist path, permission recovery and a real-phone run, after #798, #800, #819, #820, #830. | Consumer journey owner. | Open. No label. |

| [#823](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/823) receipts | #776 backend draft foundation; native capture and local store. | Local and simulator. | Native has no `/financial/documents` client. Missing: connection to the backend, canonical save and split, private Storage (#778), Render Workflows job (`financial_documents.py` still uses `BackgroundTasks`; `workflows/main.py` has only `workflow_proof` and `run_backtest_job`), shared consent policy (#828), real camera proof, baseline comparison. | Consumer and storage owners; blocked by #778, #828, #822. | Open.

The observation reader exists only on the recovery branch (`5aa369d9e`), with no production caller. Historical type and ownership attribution contract needs review before any migration. | Foundations owner and Home owner; #877 R2. | Open. No label. |
| [#825](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/825) Updates, reminders, push | Native states only.

### Follow-ups and narrow fixes

| Issue | Finding | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#840](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/840) dark-mode text | Not fixed on integration. The issue's suspected cause, `Color(white: 0.08)` at `ConnectedCuadraoShell.swift` line 81, is unchanged. A shared-palette fix for auth fields exists only on the recovery branch. | Open. Revalidate in #877 R4. |
| [#841](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/841) flaky canary test | Probably the same socket-reuse mechanism as #861, but that is an inference. No change maps an unowned transport failure to a reason code. | Open. Close only with a bounded repro or repeated green runs, or a linked duplicate finding. |
| [#842](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/842) native test debt | No commit references it and it has not been rerun at head. | Open. #877 R4 revalidates. |
| #861, #867, #872 | Narrow fixes already closed. No contradicting evidence found. | Stay closed. |

## Open product decisions

The Trust ledger [gates.md](evidence/cuadrao-trust-20261005/orchestration/gates.md)
records six open gates. A search of the decision log, master plan, execution
board, MVEE, lane documents and every comment on #808, #813, #814, #815 and #744
found no founder answer to any of them. Two other gates in that file are
resolved.

| Gate | Answer on record | What it blocks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identity-policy`: #798 allowlist orphans and Hide My Email linking | Absent. The October 5 Apple-session lock states that it does not select this policy. | #798 items 1 and 3, #821 acceptance |
| `balance-source`: #805 canonical source and settlement owner | Partial. Decision 17 locks the outcome and copy. The source and who may settle are not decided. | #805, #822 deletion journey |
| `consent-policy`: #828 consent scope, versioning, memory and voice | Absent. Option A is a proposal, not a lock. | #828, #827, #823 dispatch, #831 AI disclosure |
| `space-model`: #819 personal roots with household grants versus household-owned roots | Partial. Timing is locked before TestFlight. The model choice is open. | #819, #818, #820 consumers |
| `release-jobs`: #818 and #826 first retained chat jobs and memory/voice | Absent. Stack and providers are locked and explicitly do not settle inclusion. | #818, #826, #827, #829 memory rows |
| `apple-late-cleanup`: #803 late provider revocation | Absent. | #803 only |

The recommendations on file are in `foundation-contract-map-proposed.md` and
`gates.md`. This record does not accept them. None of these gates blocks the
#877 recovery of the approved design.

**#781.** The hold stands. Landed work does not discharge it. Deletion is behind
`ARGUS_ACCOUNT_DELETION_ENABLED=false` and Apple and Google are default off, so
the Terms line promising deletion from the app is not yet true. The draft's
deletion text omits decision 17 (placeholder member, frozen balances, plan
handover) and calls deletion final, which the #845 recommendations contradict
because deletion can stay pending until providers confirm. Its provider list
omits Perplexity and OpenRouter memory assessment, and it names Plaid, Gmail,
voice and PostHog without saying "only if enabled". Still open and not
invented here: operating entity and jurisdiction (P4), support address (P5),
publication location (P6), actual backup, log and analytics retention (P7), and
counsel review (P8). Editing the draft needs an assignment under #831.

**#774.** Its landing report, the PR #773 register section, the stale-sentence
corrections (lane header and the sentences still calling that lane unmerged) and
the `DOCUMENTATION_AUTHORITY.md` correction were unique and are restored by this
change. Its header rewrites of the board and the ledger would have regressed
newer status and were dropped. It carried a stale parity sentence naming
`.github/argus-env.sh`, which no longer holds the flag; the restored record says
so. Close #774 as superseded by the pull request that carries this record.

**#732.** Owner is the founder. The comment's whole text is that it needs rework
and a decision from the founder and is deferred. It records no date, assignee or
trigger. No merge, rework, rebase or close is recorded here.

**#646.** It changes model-facing text, so the repository's scorecard rule
applies before any merge. Its measurement baseline now needs recomputing because
integration changed `result_conversation.py` in `c77ff4ba7` after the proposal
was written. No go exists on the PR or on #606.

## Corrections made to tracking text

- #817 body: current status section and checklist annotations; the sentences
  calling PR #835 unmerged are corrected with a dated note; the earlier October 4
  status text is preserved.
- The unticked boxes inside #803, #804 and #807 now match landed work.
- Dated reconciliation comments on each open in-scope issue state what is
  complete, what is missing, what evidence closes it and who owns it.
- The execution board gains an October 6 checkpoint and the restored #773
  landing register. `DOCUMENTATION_AUTHORITY.md` no longer lists shared Plan
  consumers as unsettled.

## What needs Lucas

1. Answer `space-model` and `release-jobs`. They gate #818, which blocks eleven
   issues, and they unlock the matrix, the migration and the first chat jobs.
2. Authorize publication of the recovery pull request and set a phone window for
   the combined Check build, once the recovery lead reports R1 to R4 done.
3. Later and independent: the other four gates, the PostHog deletion access, the
   legal facts for #781, the hosted readbacks, #732 reactivation and the #646 go.

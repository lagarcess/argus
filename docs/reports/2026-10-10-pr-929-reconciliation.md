# PR929 integration reconciliation

The coordinator assigned the first reconciliation slot to PR929. The founder's clarified scope is to land Marketing through PR939 and PR929 evidence. PR927 remains a separate main-promotion hold and must not be retargeted. Nothing lands in main. No merge or auto-merge slot has been granted to this lane yet.

## Decision continuity

The [Marketing handoff](../handoffs/cuadrao-marketing-launch-lane.md) identifies PR929 as the correction for stale privacy/contact evidence and the two rollback notes. Those exact changes remain the approved patch. Later founder instructions accepted and locked PR939, requested refreshing PR927, and then explicitly kept PR927 on hold: "Keep #939 design; don't ship pages until both are settled." The coordinator subsequently relayed the narrower landing decision: "land via #939 (+ #929 evidence). Keep #927's main-promotion hold. Don't retarget #927. nothing lands in main." This reconciliation follows that sequence and does not reinterpret older handoff text as a release grant.

## Branch and evidence

- Repository: `lagarcess/argus`; target: `codex/private-alpha-next`.
- Owner checkout: `/Users/garces/Documents/projects/repos/argus-worktrees/cuadrao-landing`, branch `codex/cuadrao-evidence-refresh`.
- Original integration base: `5d9a1f55aa03a56a1b8e3afb064f4b4c70e25aec`.
- Previous published head: `f555e53267b71bc36417fbbbabad9c2c636d1ff9`.
- Current integration base: `cd14c9883f180876d27c121f0787b25a73529492`.
- One-way reconciliation merge: `595568aa83887c3a071510f5504554b9a8eca1a8`.

The nine intervening integration commits share no changed paths with the original 13-file PR929 patch. The merge had no conflicts. The evidence directory, Marketing README and launch runbook are byte-identical to the previous published PR929 head. No application runtime, API contract, migration or provider configuration differs from current integration.

The historical captures remain evidence for `5d9a1f55a`, as their existing manifest states. They have not been relabelled as pictures of the later PR939 design or current hosted pages. No evidence was invalidated by this reconciliation. Browser recapture and paid/provider tests are unnecessary for this documentation-only delta.

## Verification and next handoff

All 84 focused documentation-link and CI-policy tests passed. Changed-document local links, diff whitespace and the modularity budget passed on the reconciled tree. Exact-head CI and the final review result are reported in the [PR929 completion comment](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/pull/929) after they finish. No pre-push claim of green CI is made here.

After PR929 lands, reconcile PR939 against the new integration head. Its `marketing/README.md` and `docs/runbooks/cuadrao-marketing-launch.md` overlap this evidence correction. Preserve the main-specific rollback explanation and the accepted PR939 design.

Deployment, hosted changes, real email and public forms stay on hold. Page publication requires approved Spanish and English privacy wording naming the actual responsible operator for Meta, plus separate LLC clearance. No operator name is invented and "LLC pending" is not approved published wording. A later pages-first version must explicitly withhold both forms. These publication holds do not authorize changes to PR927 or main.

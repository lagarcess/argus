# Signup storage proof (local, synthetic addresses)

The marketing route, the real PostgREST (`supabase/postgrest:v16.3`, the image the local Supabase stack uses) and Postgres 17 with the committed migration `20260920000000_cuadrao_early_access_signups.sql`. The roles `anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role` were created as in a Supabase project. Addresses are `@example.com` and synthetic. Captured against code commit `3e6cf00de`; the handler and migration are unchanged since. This is local proof only. It is not hosted proof and it did not touch the hosted Supabase project.

## Visitor journeys through `POST /api/signups`

```
new address            {"status":"registered"} [200]
same, other case/lang  {"status":"registered"} [200]
rows after both        1 row: ana@example.com, language es, consent_version early-access-2026-10
operator removal       UPDATE 1   (email set null, removed_at set)
same visitor again     {"status":"registered"} [200]
rows after             1 row: email null, removed true   <- still one row, not re-registered
```

Anon key against the same PostgREST:

```
GET  /cuadrao_early_access_signups   {"code":"42501", "message":"permission denied for table ..."} [401]
POST /cuadrao_early_access_signups   {"code":"42501", "message":"permission denied for table ..."} [401]
```

## Operator tool (`bun run scripts/signups.ts`)

Three active rows inserted directly (`a`, `b` English, `c`).

```
summary                         {"active":3,"pending":3,"removed":0}
remove B@example.com            Signup removed.
remove stranger@example.com     Signup suppressed.        (never registered; suppression row created)
summary                         {"active":2,"pending":2,"removed":2}
notice --template (dry run)     {"template":"proof","recipients":2,"byLanguage":{"es":2,"en":0},"stamps":true}
                                Dry run. Nothing was sent. Add --send to send.
notice --send (no --expect)     refused: "A full send needs --expect 2 to confirm the recipient count."
rows                            a active, c active, b removed (email null), stranger suppressed (source operator-removal)
```

The removed address `b` is absent from the notice recipients. No message was sent.

## Table constraints

`tests/test_cuadrao_early_access_postgres.py`, run against the same database: 11 passed (repeat ignored, removed address keeps only its digest and blocks re-registration, seven inconsistent rows refused, `anon` and `authenticated` hold no privilege, `service_role` holds select, insert and update but not delete, RLS on with no policy). CI runs it on the full migration chain through the existing `tests/test_*_postgres.py` glob.

## Availability notice, claim-then-send (local, synthetic addresses)

The operator tool against real PostgREST (`supabase/postgrest:v16.3`) and Postgres 17 with the committed migration, and a local stand-in for Resend that answers 422 to recipients starting with `refuse` and replays the original answer for a repeated idempotency key. Four active rows were inserted; one was removed before the run.

```
first send       {"recipients":3} then {"sent":2,"failed":1,"skipped":0,"unknownOutcome":[],"stoppedEarly":false}
rows after       keep1 notified, keep2 notified, refuse1 NOT notified (claim released), removed row erased and not selected
provider log     keep1, keep2, refuse1 (the removed address was never mailed)
rerun            {"recipients":1} then {"sent":0,"failed":1}: only the refused row is tried again; keep1 and keep2 are not mailed again
exit code        1 for a run with a refused recipient
```

The 129 unit tests model the same database and provider and include the cases a local stand-in cannot reach: a removal between listing and sending (skipped), a refused claim (nothing sent, run stops), 409 and 5xx answers (row stays claimed and named), a lost response retried once under the same key (one message), and no answer after the retry (named, and a rerun skips it). Two mutations were applied and caught: treating 409 as a plain refusal, and claiming without the active-row filter.

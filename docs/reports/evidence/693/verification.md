Environment notes: the locked SciPy 1.15.3 required the official macOS 12 ARM
wheel locally. No dependency file was changed. The sandboxed production build
stalled; restarting the same check outside the sandbox passed. Next.js's
build-generated local tsconfig additions were discarded. Direct `tsc --noEmit`
reports existing Bun test-shim and legacy E2E type diagnostics; production
build TypeScript passed, and no runtime-source diagnostics were reported.
The production build, full web unit suite, lint, and modularity checks passed
after the lifecycle change. The 38-case backend check also passed again and
verifies real chat response headers at configured limits and UTC-day boundaries.
The 346-case backend/mocked-eval evidence is retained: this follow-up changes only
web presentation/state, with no backend or model-facing changes. Final-head CI
covers the production build and backend again.

Review flags: package 0B-1 requires Priya's written eval verdict before merge.
That internal verdict remains pending; this report does not supply it.
Analytics/event code is untouched for #702. The 0B-1 spec needs no new event.
The PR terminal audit records final head, CI and Codex review outcomes.

CI follow-up: the first backend run passed 9,037 tests but detected that
`chat-recovery-display.test.ts` had crossed the 1,000-line registration
threshold. Its duplicated catalog translator now lives in shared test support
and both recovery suites reuse it. All 2,155 web tests and all eight modularity
unit checks pass after extraction. No assertion was removed, no budget was
raised. Browser evidence was retained for that test-support extraction, then
recaptured for the daily-cap notice refinement. Final CI is recorded in the PR
audit.

# Business vision coverage

This matrix checks website coverage. It is not a release manifest. The Business product is in development. Interactive demonstrations use fictional records. Shared consumer capabilities do not establish Business availability.

Sources read on October 6, 2026:

- **MVEE-B**: the supplied `/Users/garces/.codex/worktrees/baaf/private-alpha-next/docs/specs/argus-minimum-viable-ecosystem-experience.md`.
- **MVEE-C**: [current MVEE](../../../specs/argus-minimum-viable-ecosystem-experience.md). Its October 4 recurring and category sections are newer than the supplied version.
- **Plan**: [Cuadrao master plan](../../../specs/cuadrao-master-plan.md). Proposals are not founder locks or shipped capabilities.
- **Decisions**: [decision log](../../../specs/argus-decision-log.md), including October 4 launch, currency, recurring and October 6 assistant decisions.
- **Brief**: `/tmp/cuadrao-business-website-brief.md`.

The implemented page covers all 25 rows below. “Demonstrated” means a working local interaction with fictional records, not a shipped Business capability. “Explained” means copy or FAQ coverage, not a working product feature.

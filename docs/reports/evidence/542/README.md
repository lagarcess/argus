# Issue #542 — Durable Pre-Start Backtest Failure Evidence

Date: 2026-09-03 (America/Chicago)

## Production incident

The source is [issue #542](https://github.com/lagarcess/argus/issues/542),
including its production message, API-log, job, and run readback.

- Conversation `91931579-0cc8-4fa0-bedd-726abb0afa9c` retained one succeeded
  job and one completed run. Both belong to the earlier three-symbol
  NVDA/MSFT/PLTR test.
- The later card kept confirmation identity
  `confirmation-17470c6c-83e9-4305-bf6d-645ec3a40be9` while changing the
  launch to NVDA/MSFT/PLTR/GOOGL/AMZN, buy and hold, `$100,000`, with the
  requested end set to the current day.
- The reservation read returned the earlier job, and the atomic admission RPC
  returned `decision = conflict`. No workflow dispatch followed.
- The API then stored only the generic assistant sentence. It inserted neither
  a job receipt nor a run for the refused attempt, so the sentence had no
  durable failure code or detail behind it.

## Reproduced trigger

`tests/test_issue_542_durable_backtest_failures.py` reconstructs the five-symbol,
`$100,000`, current-day launch against the spent confirmation identity. Before
the fix, the test failed because there was no spent-identity guard and a
conflict returned no failed job. The trigger is therefore **confirmation
identity reuse after that identity already reserved the earlier run**.

The current day is part of the changed launch identity, but it is not the
failing coverage trigger on this base. The prior #475 byte-hash failure was
checked rather than assumed:

- Commit `716221f0` / PR #477 is already in base `5d408acf`.
- Its shared daily-coverage rule clamps an end-today equity request to the
  latest completed session before both preflight and worker hashing.
- The focused #475 tests still prove the effective windows and byte hashes
  agree while today's forming bar changes.

## Repaired invariants

1. The durable job reservation is the owner of whether a confirmation identity
   is spent. Before appending a new card, the API replaces any already-reserved
   identity across the confirmation payload and artifact reference.
2. If admission still refuses a chat launch, the API inserts a separate
   terminal `backtest_jobs` receipt. It has a stable, derived
   `rejection:<hash>` identity distinct from the rejected confirmation key, the
   attempted identity and launch payload, `status = failed`, and stable
   `failure_code`, `failure_detail`, and `retryable` values. A replay returns
   that same receipt, and the earlier reservation is not changed.
3. The runtime links that failed job as the attempt's artifact and chooses the
   user-safe assistant message from the stored `failure_code`. An identity
   conflict keeps the failed job terminal while exposing the existing Retry
   action, which rebuilds the setup as a fresh confirmation before another run.

## Browser acceptance

The Chromium acceptance flow uses the reproduced five-symbol, `$100,000`,
end-today setup and drives the stream contract through the admission-conflict
decision. It proves the failed card renders the recorded reason and a visible
Retry action, reloads the conversation and proves both survive hydration, then
clicks Retry and verifies the structured failed-action identity produces a new
active confirmation.

## Deterministic verification

The regression was exercised without another paid/provider backtest because
the production readback already proves the admission decision and the failure
is entirely before workflow dispatch.

The two runtime timing variables are blanked only to keep the test module's
monkeypatched timeout values from being overridden by this worktree's ignored
`.env`. The production defaults and source are unchanged.

## Review closure

The first exact-head Codex review identified two valid gaps in the initial
repair. The follow-up delta now proves both:

- An identity-conflict job remains terminal and non-retryable, while its
  failed-action artifact exposes Retry. That established action rebuilds a
  fresh confirmation instead of resubmitting the spent confirmation ID.
- Refusal receipts use a stable derived key over the attempted action. The
  existing database uniqueness boundary makes a concurrent or transport replay
  converge on the first receipt; the gateway reads and validates that receipt
  after a unique violation instead of inserting a duplicate.

Integration reconciliation and exact-head CI are recorded in the pull request
once the candidate head is published.

## Full local sweep

`poetry run pytest tests -q --no-cov` completed with 5,793 passed, 533 skipped,
and 20 unrelated failures. Fourteen require loopback socket binding or process
inspection denied by the local sandbox. Five are controlled by ignored local
`.env` feature flags or timeout overrides and pass when rerun in the clean base
archive. The remaining OpenRouter failure-origin assertion also fails on the
untouched `5d408acf` base. The clean-host GitHub suite remains the terminal
full-suite gate.

The fetched `origin/codex/private-alpha-next` head was still exactly
`5d408acf6b1ed9608dfe8b757ff41372f9b9daeb`, so no reconciliation merge or
evidence invalidation was required.

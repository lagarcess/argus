# Compatibility matrix (October 8, 2026)

Local, synthetic, nothing hosted. Throwaway databases on the Supabase CLI's local Postgres 17.6. Candidate `cad1cbe1ec27ff89c08eadbec31718a0e627383c` (the Build 1 freeze). Previous production code is `main` `a9286b21886eb03df7a21f2f4b7d5e79af570679`.

`compat_matrix.py` builds three schema states from a production-equivalent fixture (effects of `main`'s files plus production's 81 ledger rows), each through the real applier, then runs each code version's real-Postgres test files (`tests/*postgres*.py`) against a fresh copy of each state.

| Schema state | Previous production code (34 files) | Build 1 code (73 files) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **S0** today | 379 passed, 27 skipped, 1 failed | 409 passed, 227 failed, 304 errors (needs the new tables) |
| **S1** after C0 (website migration alone) | 379 passed, 27 skipped, 1 failed | 420 passed, 216 failed, 304 errors (still needs C1) |
| **S2** after C1 (consumer files, plus the unrecorded `20260505000001`) | 379 passed, 27 skipped, 1 failed | **722 passed, 31 skipped, 1 failed, 0 errors** |

## After the first Business step (B1, `20261008100000`), Build 2 candidate `64833f6d284d60562829c0545dc413d5324c9d5a`

Applied on top of C1 with the real applier (`ARGUS_COMPAT_TAIL`), then the same suites:

| Code | Result on C1 + B1 |
| --- | --- |
| Previous production code (`main` `a9286b21`) | 379 passed, 27 skipped, 1 failed |
| Build 1 (`cad1cbe1e`) | 722 passed, 31 skipped, 1 failed, 0 errors |
| Build 2 (`64833f6d2`) | 727 passed, 52 skipped, 1 failed, 0 errors |

The one failure is the same scipy import trap in every run. Build 2 skips 21 more tests than Build 1: they need a running local Storage service, which a plain database does not have, so Storage behavior itself (bucket limits, object delete on disconnect and on account deletion) is **not** exercised here; Business proved it against a local Storage stack (#905, #914 evidence). The rehearsal databases get the `storage` schema from the local container, as hosted always has it.

## After all four Business steps (B1 to B4), final integration code `f5a2007cd6f8e169a27cb1e6e3827ccbaa1bfb9a`

C1 plus `20261008100000`, `20261008110000`, `20261008130000` and `20261008140000`, each through the real applier, then the same suites (`results_tail_b1_b4.json`; the "build2" row in that file is the final integration code, not the earlier Build 2 candidate):

| Code | Result on C1 + B1 to B4 |
| --- | --- |
| Previous production code (`main` `a9286b21`) | 379 passed, 27 skipped, 1 failed |
| Build 1 (`cad1cbe1e`) | 720 passed, 31 skipped, 3 failed |
| Final integration (`f5a2007cd`) | 771 passed, 84 skipped, 2 failed |

Failures, read one by one. Four kinds, kept apart:

**1. Environment, not schema.** `test_asset_rollup_pair_symbol_normalization_matches_memory_contract` fails in every row: the local `scipy` import trap (#852).

**2. Outdated census tests, not a demonstrated runtime incompatibility.** Build 1 also fails `test_account_deletion_fk_census_postgres.py::test_sweep_names_every_user_reference_and_the_census_document_matches_it` and `test_client_grants_postgres.py::test_every_relation_is_listed_exactly_once`. Both compare Build 1's own documented lists (the deletion foreign-key census and the client-grants relations) with the live schema, so they fail whenever the schema grows (`spaces`, `whatsapp_*`, rows keyed by `owner_space_id`). They show that Build 1 does not *know about* the B2 to B4 tables. They do not show that Build 1 fails to read or delete anything: no test here runs Build 1 code against rows in those tables. That is a gap, not a pass. The final code's versions of these two tests pass.

**3. Order-dependent failure: cause found, test-fixture race, no production-recovery impact.** The final integration code failed `test_document_jobs_postgres.py::test_two_running_instances_recover_a_dead_worker_without_restart` (`needs_attention` instead of `review_ready`). Business found the cause: without `ARGUS_LOCAL_SUPABASE_URL`, `tests/document_sources_support.py` built a new in-memory source bucket per call, so the test's two simulated API instances had separate buckets and a redispatch could miss the upload (`document_source_unavailable`, then `needs_attention`). It is a coin flip (6 of 12 runs alone), not run order. This rehearsal did not set that variable, which is why it failed here; Linux CI sets it, shares real Storage and passes. Production always uses `SupabaseSourceObjects`, so recovery is unaffected. The fix is PR #924 (one shared in-memory store, test-only). Cause and impact recorded here before the release that carries #908, as required.

**4. The intermittent Storage disconnect failure: test interference, CLOSED by the founder's acceptance of Business's durable evidence.** With local Storage set, `test_document_source_objects_postgres.py::test_disconnect_removes_the_object_and_keeps_confirmed_activity` failed intermittently with `document_version_conflict` (about 1 in 3 on unmodified #905 code). It is **not** resolved by the separate document-jobs fixture diagnosis (item 3); it is its own question: can disconnect leave a Storage object or an import behind? It was held as a blocker until Business established its cause and showed a fix or evidence that it is test-only; the founder has now accepted that evidence.

Business's current report, not independently reproduced here: a hung run of the old jobs test kept two sweepers alive on the real clock while the Storage tests lease on a fixed 2026-09-20 clock, so they saw live leases as expired and advanced the draft mid-preparation (15 of 20 failures with the hung process attached, 20 of 20 passes away from it); production's API and sweeper share one clock, a held lease is respected, an expired lease ends `document_lease_lost`, and disconnect marks the connection first with every Storage write checking that status under a lock. A deterministic test, `test_disconnect_during_preparation_leaves_no_object_and_no_row`, covers the mid-preparation case. The test-only fixes landed in #924 (`cd3231baa` on integration). **Evidence received from Business (commit `b757fc9a0`, branch `claude/evidence-storage-disconnect`, folder `docs/reports/evidence/cuadrao-business-owner-pilot/2026-10-08-storage-disconnect-proof`).** On integration `826ace6d4`, unmodified, with a dedicated fresh stack and local Storage set, each run started with `env -i` (command and redacted env in the folder): the Storage file alone, 20 fresh runs, both disconnect tests 20 of 20; the jobs file first and then Storage, 20 runs, both 20 of 20; `ps` and `pg_stat_activity` at start and end showing only the stack's own sessions; a control with a foreign real-clock sweeper on the same database reproduced `document_version_conflict` in 3 of 5 runs, which confirms the cause; and a file:line audit (`audit.md`) of every path that can advance a draft or run a sweeper. Business's conclusion: within one pytest process nothing can advance these drafts on the real clock any more, and the residual exposure is operational (a second process sharing the database; one database per pytest process). I checked the result files by inspection, not by re-running: the 40 runs without the foreign sweeper contain no failure or error, and the three failing files are control runs 1, 4 and 5, all with `document_version_conflict`.

**Status: closed for this specific finding (founder, October 8).** This does **not** authorize hosted receipt access, and it does **not** replace the separate hosted storage and deletion smoke test (one synthetic document stored, the synthetic account deleted, the Storage object confirmed gone), which stays a separate founder approval required before receipt access is enabled.

**The minimum-version rule, stated by stored data.** A code version is a safe runtime only for stored data it can both read and delete:
- Previous production code: Personal chat data only.
- Build 1 (`cad1cbe1e`): Personal data plus the financial tables C1 added, including the financial-data deletion path. It has no knowledge of B1 to B4 data. It is not a supported runtime once any B1 to B4 table holds rows.
- Build 2 (`64833f6d2`) and later: also documents and their Storage objects (B1), with read and delete of those, and account deletion in every state.
- Code that reads or deletes B2 to B4 data (spaces, WhatsApp links, preparation jobs): the later integration code that carries it, as named in the enable request for each flag.
The first hosted write of new-format data in a table sets the minimum for that table. Rolling back below the code that can read and delete it means turning that feature's flag off and fixing forward.

- Final integration also fails `test_document_jobs_postgres.py::test_two_running_instances_recover_a_dead_worker_without_restart` (`needs_attention` instead of `review_ready`). It passes when run alone on the same database and fails again in a full-suite run on a fresh copy, so it is order-dependent in this local macOS run. The same commit's CI is green on Linux. Cause not found; reported to Business.

## What it shows

- **Deploy order.** Build 1 code needs C1 first. On today's schema, or after C0 only, it fails on the missing tables. C1 must be applied and verified before Build 1 deploys.
- **Old code on the new schema.** Previous production code gives the same result on S0, S1 and S2: C0 and C1 do not break what it already did, in these suites. Reverting the application code after C1 is therefore possible at the database level, until new-format data is written (the minimum compatible code version applies from the first hosted financial write).
- **Client grants.** Comparing `anon` and `authenticated` grants between S0 and S2 on tables, columns and routines: 0 removed. 19 table grants, 161 column grants and 1 routine grant added, all on the new financial tables and `is_active_household_member`. Old code reaching the database as a client sees no lost access.
- **The one failing test**, in all six runs, is `tests/test_search_postgres.py::test_asset_rollup_pair_symbol_normalization_matches_memory_contract`. It fails with a local `scipy` import error (`dlopen ... _spropack`), the macOS arm64 runtime trap tracked in #852. It is an environment failure, not a schema one.

## What it does not show

- These are database-level suites. They do not drive the old or new API end to end, and they do not cover the web client.
- B1 to B4 (Business) are not in this table. Their compatibility, including B4's effect on Personal, is Business's evidence on #914.
- Hosted behavior (pooler, extensions, Auth) is not covered.

# Preview delta ledger

Branch `codex/cuadrao-preview-delta-20261006`, built on the recovery candidate
`codex/cuadrao-recovery-r1-20261006` at `779c22f56`. Checkpoint: the approved Preview at
`5753b5d7cb3e4a13b4bac58a87fa32127b6fcf37`.

Founder instruction: go back to the application that had the checkpoint, see where the delta is,
and rewire accordingly. The Preview view layer is the base. Every line that still differs from the
checkpoint under `ios/ArgusFoundation/Cuadrao/**` and `ios/ArgusFoundation/ReleaseUI/**` is listed
here with its class and reason. A reviewer reads this file beside
`git diff 5753b5d7 HEAD -- ios/ArgusFoundation/Cuadrao ios/ArgusFoundation/ReleaseUI`.

Classes:

- SEAM: an opt-in parameter, protocol or extracted component that lets connected data feed the
  same Preview view. The Preview, with its defaults and fixtures, renders what it rendered at the
  checkpoint.
- FIX: a defect fix the Preview itself needed, or one the connected app needs that leaves the
  Preview's default-size rendering unchanged.
- NEW: a file added since the checkpoint, holding code extracted from a canvas.

## Method

1. `preview-delta/hunk_inventory.py` split the checkpoint-to-candidate diff into one file per
   changed source file (55 files, 2,799 insertions, 1,362 deletions).
2. Four read-only reviewers classified every hunk against
   `preview-delta/CLASSIFY-CONTRACT.md`, comparing the checkpoint tree with the candidate tree and
   naming the connected caller of each seam. Their hunk-level reports are kept verbatim under
   `preview-delta/classify-*.md`; this ledger is the per-file summary.
3. Every hunk classed DRIFT was restored to the checkpoint behavior (section "Restored"). Where the
   connected app needed the changed behavior, it became an opt-in whose default is the checkpoint.
4. Connected hosts that still used an Argus-styled view for a surface the Preview owns were rewired
   to the Preview component (section "Rewired").

## Restored

| Commit | File | What the checkpoint had and what came back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `66ef4b1e6` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift` | `.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)` on the canvas root above its sheets and the receipt flow. Without it, Ask from a receipt review and from an account inside Novedades did nothing in the Preview. |
| `a8c48fde9` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoBalanceBreakdown.swift` | Row amount `row.change ?? row.closing ?? "—"` and the checkpoint caption rule. The connected overview opts into `missingCoverage: true` to keep "Sin datos" and "Sin inicio registrado" for periods without a recorded opening (PARITY-COMMON: known zero only with confirmed coverage). |
| `0353f232f` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoAppShell.swift` | No `.font(.body)` on the shell root. The modifier only undid the Argus root font; the Argus chrome now sits on the sample shell and the auth flow (`Connected/ConnectedCuadraoRoot.swift`), so the signed-in shell inherits nothing, like the Preview. |
| `13480d9a0` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomePresentation.swift` | No `.accessibilityLabel(currency + amount)` on the hero amount; VoiceOver reads the amount as at the checkpoint. |
| `5fa79433b` | `Cuadrao/Planning/CuadraoPlanDetailPresentation.swift`, `CuadraoPlanComposition.swift` | No `plan-detail-amount` or `plan-first-create` identifiers in the Preview tree (neither had a reader); connected hosts pass their own amount identifiers. |
| `bd952b7e0` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoProfilePage.swift` | Security footer "Las sesiones reales se mostrarán al conectar tu cuenta." and Usage description "Verás tu disponibilidad y cuándo se renueva al conectar tu cuenta." with their English. |
| `65cecadbb` | `Cuadrao/CuadraoSearchPresentation.swift` | `LazyVStack` results container (the checkpoint perf fix) and the rail's default bounce. The connected host opts into `eagerRows: true` for scroll restoration; the size-based bounce rule applies only with the connected refresh attached. |
| `4c553e7f3` | `Cuadrao/Planning/CuadraoPlanDisplay.swift`, `CuadraoPlanCanvas.swift` | The hold-to-reset menu on the "Lo que viene" title only, not on the whole header row and its "+" button. |
| `fb006a79a` | `Cuadrao/Planning/CuadraoPlanWhatIf.swift`, `CuadraoPlanDetail.swift` | The what-if draft resets on any plan change (`resetsOn: plan`), not only when the scenario moves. |

Hunk classes the reviewers left UNSURE and how they were decided:

- `CuadraoCanvas.swift` palette gate (always adaptive): SEAM. The flagged Preview launch resolved
  every token through the adaptive path already; the change affects the connected app and Xcode
  `#Preview` macros only. Owner: `9746bb602`, dark appearance for the connected app.
- `CuadraoHomePresentation.swift` accessibility-size layouts of `CuadraoFeedRow` and
  `CuadraoBalanceAmount`: FIX. Default size is byte-identical; the stacked layout at accessibility
  sizes is the documented decision "Stack the balance header for accessibility text sizes" in
  `../decisions.md` (`eddb7da97`).
- `CuadraoSearchPresentation.swift` rail bounce: restored for the Preview (see above).

## Rewired

| Commit | Surface | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d1b603f7c` | Record movement sheet (Preview side) | `Cuadrao/CuadraoTransactionSheet.swift` extracts the sheet chrome from `CuadraoTransactionCanvas`: account header, "Añadir movimiento" / "Revisar movimiento" titles, Cancel / Atrás, bottom "Revisar" / "Guardar". Every optional defaults to the Preview's words; the canvas keeps its fields and sample save. |
| `3ace1ce80` | Record movement sheet (connected) | `Accounts/ConnectedTransactionSheet.swift` hosts `FinancialActivityEditor` in that sheet. Kinds, account choices, loan split, source, purchase, category, note, correction reason, server review with coverage answers, goal and debt previews, uncertain and conflict phases, and every `loop.*` identifier the UI journeys use are kept. `FinancialActivityEditorView.swift` (29 `ArgusStyle` uses) is deleted; it had no other caller. |
| `af1274aa3` | Updates | The "Todas / Sin leer" picker and "Marcar todas como leídas" hide while updates are `.unavailable` (a connected-only state; the Preview never reaches it). |

Extensions to Preview components for connected fields, all opt-in with Preview defaults:

- `CuadraoTransactionSheet`: `title`, `primaryTitle`, `primaryEnabled`, `primaryBusy`,
  `primaryIdentifier`, `cancelDisabled`, `dismissDisabled`, `scrollTarget`, and an artwork-less
  account header (`CuadraoTransactionAccount.symbol`) for account types without Preview artwork.
  The connected entry renders the kind choice as the Preview plan editor's chips (the two-way
  segmented "Tipo" control cannot hold seven kinds), account, source, purchase and category choices
  as `CuadraoChoiceMenu` rows, and the review as the Preview's rows plus per-account impact cards.
- `CuadraoBalanceBreakdown.missingCoverage`, `CuadraoSearchContent.eagerRows`,
  `CuadraoPlanHeader.titleMenu`, `CuadraoPlanWhatIf.resetsOn` (this lane).

## Surviving deviations under Cuadrao/** and ReleaseUI/**

Owner `#877` is the connected-interface recovery unless another issue or commit is named.
"Extraction" means code moved out of a canvas into a shared component with the same strings,
fonts, spacing, identifiers and modifiers; the canvas calls it with its fixtures.

| File | Class | Reason | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Cuadrao/CanvasAccountPresentation.swift` | NEW, SEAM | Extraction of `CanvasAccountRow` body, account detail header and activity row from `CuadraoAccountsPreview.swift` and `CuadraoAccountCanvas.swift`; defaulted `amountIdentifier`, `amountAccessibilityLabel`, `notes`. | #877 |

| `Cuadrao/CuadraoDistributionContent.swift` | NEW, SEAM | Extraction of the distribution body from `CuadraoHomeDistribution.swift`. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoFirstAccountSheet.swift` | SEAM | `CanvasAccountEntry` state and `CuadraoAccountEntryForm` extracted; `editing`, `ids`, `status`, `primaryTitle`, `locked`, `busy` default to the Preview sheet. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomeBalanceChart.swift` | SEAM | `partial` override and `amountIdentifier` defaults; amount row via `CuadraoBalanceAmount`; `!period.changes.isEmpty` never flips in the Preview. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift` | SEAM | Hosts through `CuadraoAppShell` and `CuadraoHomeLayout`; toast and empty states extracted. Chat environment restored (this lane). | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomeDistribution.swift` | SEAM | Body via `CuadraoDistributionContent`; unused `typeSize` dropped. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoHomeEmptyState.swift` | SEAM | `if shared` hoisted; identical branches. | #877 |

| `Cuadrao/CuadraoProfileCanvas.swift` | SEAM | `CuadraoProfileBody` extracted with empty account rows for the Preview; editor takes bindings, optional email and `saveNames`. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoProfilePage.swift` | SEAM | `includeExamples`, currency binding row, development notice sections and legal link fallback for the connected host; approved footers restored (this lane). | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoSearchCanvas.swift` | SEAM | Field, rail, filters and empty states moved to `CuadraoSearchPresentation`. | #877 |
| `Cuadrao/CuadraoSearchPresentation.swift` | NEW, SEAM | Extraction; `accessibility` prefixes, `showsFilters`, `loading`, `refresh`, `eagerRows` default to the Preview. | #877 |

| `ReleaseUI/Identity/ReleaseIdentityModels.swift` | SEAM | New `ReleaseDeletionState` cases. | `d18070101` |

Noted for the owner, not Preview drift: the four new deletion sections in
`ReleaseDeleteAccountView.swift` read `Localizable.strings` while their siblings use the inline
`text(es, en)` helper; a Spanish locale that does not resolve to `es-419` would mix languages.

## Connected hosts outside Cuadrao/** touched by this lane

- `ArgusFoundationApp.swift`, `Connected/ConnectedCuadraoRoot.swift`: Argus tint, ink and body
  font moved from the app root onto the sample shell and the auth flow.
- `Connected/ConnectedCuadraoBalanceOverview.swift`: `missingCoverage: true`.
- `Search/FinancialSearchView.swift`: `eagerRows: true`.
- `Accounts/AccountActivityView.swift`: the editor presenter shows `ConnectedTransactionSheet`.
- `Accounts/ConnectedTransactionSheet.swift` added; `Accounts/FinancialActivityEditorView.swift`
  deleted.

## Surfaces that still have no Preview component

These keep their connected views and are listed so nobody mistakes them for omissions:

- Account details and reviewed starting balance (`Accounts/AccountForm.swift`, reached from the
  connected account detail "Edit" and "Opening balance"): the Preview has only the first-account
  and rename sheets, which the connected app already uses.
- Check balance and expected-expense editor (`Accounts/FinancialEditorView.swift`): the Preview's
  "Comprobar balance" is an informational alert.
- Recurring expectation form and occurrence sheet (`Plan/FinancialPlanForms.swift`): the Preview
  plan editor has goal, month and debt kinds only; the recurring journey depends on
  `plan.expectation.*`.
- Goal allocation and link sheets (`Plan/FinancialGoalActions.swift`), asset editor
  (`Accounts/FinancialAssetEditor.swift`): no Preview counterpart.
- Expanded Actividad categories, highlights and paging (#824), Updates inbox (#825), chat replies
  and Ask (#826, #827): need backend reads the API does not expose yet.

Candidate tree read at `/Users/garces/Documents/projects/repos/argus/.claude/worktrees/cuadrao-delta/ios/ArgusFoundation/`.
Connected caller paths below are relative to `ios/ArgusFoundation/`.

Reading conventions:
- "Preview" means the design preview launch (`CuadraoDesignPreview.isActive == true`, i.e. `--cuadrao-design` or the `CUADRAO_DESIGN_PREVIEW` plist key).
- Additive accessibility identifiers (an id placed where the checkpoint had none) are recorded inside SEAM items; they do not change rendering. A changed or removed id would be DRIFT; none was found in these files.
- Where a classification depends on a fact I could not observe without a build (a rendering at accessibility sizes, an inherited-font effect), the item says UNSURE and names both classes.

Reason: `TabView(selection: tabSelection)` became `CuadraoAppShell(selection:chat:spanish:showsNavigation:compact:avatar:profileName:showProposal:)`; the `showsNavigation` and `compact` expressions are the checkpoint's inline conditions verbatim, and `showProposal: { voiceProposal = .proposed }` is passed, so the shell appends `selection = .plan; chat.voice.presentation = .compact` exactly as the checkpoint closure did. The `ScrollView { VStack(spacing: 36) { VStack(spacing: 18) { header; selector; household } ; sections; customize } .padding(.horizontal, 24).padding(.top, 28).padding(.bottom, 32) }.safeAreaPadding(.bottom, 80).background(WelcomePalette.background)` block became `CuadraoHomeLayout` with the same constants (see CuadraoHomePresentation.swift). The `notice: { EmptyView() }` slot contributes no spacing inside the VStack. `CuadraoNavigationScrollObserver` is now applied after `.safeAreaPadding`/`.background` instead of before; it uses `onScrollGeometryChange`, which reaches the ScrollView through wrapping modifiers, so behavior is unchanged. "Ordenar Inicio" button, `customize-home` id and `home-household-members` id are unchanged.

Split:

#### Hunk 5a: `destination(tab)` becomes `destination(tab, selection: selection)` (+1/-1)
Class: SEAM
Used by: none outside this file
Reason: The per-tab destination now receives the shell's gated `tabSelection` binding (used by the "Volver a Buscar" button, Hunk 11), which is the same binding the checkpoint's private `tabSelection` produced.

#### Hunk 5b: `.cuadraoScrollBar`, `.cuadraoSoftScrollEdges`, `.cuadraoVoicePresentation`, `.confirmationDialog`, `.tint`, `.foregroundStyle` removed (-37)
Class: SEAM
Used by: Cuadrao/CuadraoAppShell.swift:21-66 (the same modifiers, same strings, same order)
Reason: Moved verbatim into `CuadraoAppShell`. Spanish strings "¿Terminar el chat temporal?", "Terminar y salir", "Seguir aquí", "Se descartará el contenido temporal. Tu chat anterior quedará intacto." are byte-identical in the shell. One addition inside the shell (`.font(.body)`) is classified under CuadraoAppShell.swift below.

#### Hunk 5c: `.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)` removed from after `.sheet` / `.receiptPresentation` (-1)
Class: DRIFT
Used by: Cuadrao/CuadraoChatContext.swift:69 (`CuadraoContextPresentation` reads `@Environment(\.cuadraoChat)` and `guard let value, let chat else { return }`)
Reason: At the checkpoint the environment was set at line 143, after `.sheet(item:)` (140) and `.receiptPresentation` (141), so every Home sheet and the receipt flow inherited the chat. The candidate sets it only inside `CuadraoAppShell` on the `TabView`; the canvas's `.sheet` and `.receiptPresentation` are attached outside the shell and no longer carry it. Readers that lose it in the Preview: `Receipts/CuadraoReceiptReview.swift:188` ("Ask" from a receipt review) and `CuadraoUpdatesCanvas.swift:59` which hosts `CuadraoAccountCanvas` (`CuadraoAccountCanvas.swift:59`, "Preguntar a Cuadrao" from an account opened inside the Novedades sheet). With `chat == nil` the `onChange` guard returns and the tap does nothing. Views inside the tabs (chart Ask, account detail reached by navigation) still get it.
Restore: Re-add `.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)` on the canvas root after `.environment(\.receiptWorkspace, receiptWorkspace)` in `CuadraoHomeCanvas.body`, as at checkpoint line 143. The copy inside the shell can stay.

Reason: Extractions from the checkpoint `CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift`. Per struct:

- `CuadraoHomeLayout` (lines 3-30) extracted from CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift checkpoint lines 47-82 (ScrollView body). Rendering unchanged (spacing 36/18, padding 24/28/32, safe-area 80, background, "Ordenar Inicio" with `slider.horizontal.3`, id `customize-home`). SEAM.
- `CuadraoHomeGreeting` (32-42) extracted from checkpoint lines 201-205. Unchanged. SEAM.
- `CuadraoUpdatesButton` (44-63) extracted from checkpoint lines 224-236. Unchanged for a non-nil `unread`. SEAM.
- `CuadraoFeedRow` (65-83) extracted from checkpoint lines 304-313 (`feedRow`). Default type size unchanged. New: at `dynamicTypeSize.isAccessibilitySize` the amount moves under the detail line instead of trailing. Class for that branch: UNSURE FIX/DRIFT. FIX if the checkpoint row clipped or pushed the amount off-screen at AX sizes (plausible: body title plus `rowAmount` on one line); DRIFT if it did not. Introduced in 9746bb602 ("bind connected Home"), which does not name a Preview defect. Default-size rendering is byte-identical either way.
- `CuadraoUpcomingSection` (85-102) extracted from checkpoint lines 293-302 plus `sectionTitle` 317-319. Unchanged apart from additive ids `home.comingUp`, `home.viewPlan`. SEAM.
- `CuadraoBalanceAmount` (104-161) extracted from CuadraoHomeBalanceChart.swift checkpoint lines 154-173 (`amountRow`). Two differences inside the extracted copy:
  - (i) `.accessibilityLabel(currency + " " + amount)` on the amount text (9746bb602). VoiceOver reads "DOP 1,500.00" where the checkpoint read "1,500.00". No visual change. Class: DRIFT (accessibility behavior, low impact). Restore: delete the `.accessibilityLabel` line in `amountLabel`.
  - (ii) At `isAccessibilitySize` the layout becomes `VStack { HStack { currency; Spacer; expand }; amount }` (eddb7da97 "keep balance readable at accessibility sizes"). Default size keeps the checkpoint `HStack(alignment: .firstTextBaseline, spacing: 8)` with the same `Spacer(minLength: 0)` only when not expanded. Class: UNSURE FIX/DRIFT. The checkpoint amount had `lineLimit(1).minimumScaleFactor(0.5)` beside a 44pt button, so at AX5 the amount would shrink to half size; that reads as a Preview defect, which makes FIX the likelier class, but the commit only touches this file and names no reproduction. Default-size rendering is unchanged.

Reason: The row amount and caption copy changed for two account states that the Preview can reach:
  (a) An account with no balance at either end. Checkpoint amount: `"—"` (via `row.closing.map(money) ?? "—"`), caption "Sin balance" / "No balance". Candidate amount: `CuadraoMissingCoverage.amount(spanish)` = "Sin datos" / "No data", caption unchanged.
  (b) An account with a closing but no opening inside a period whose totals do have an opening (`period.change != nil`), e.g. an account added mid-period from the Preview's add-account sheet. Checkpoint: the closing balance as the amount, no caption. Candidate: "Sin datos" / "No data" with the new Spanish caption "Sin inicio registrado" / "No recorded opening".
  Fixture defaults do not hit either state (`CanvasBalanceHistory.examples` gives every account with a balance an observation on every example day, CuadraoBalanceHistory.swift checkpoint lines 70-90), so the first screen is unchanged; interaction reaches both. 38ea181ee records this as a deviation needed by connected data. Under this contract a new Spanish string on a Preview-reachable row is DRIFT; the data-honesty argument would make it FIX only if the founder accepts the new wording.
Restore: In `accountValue`, put back `Text(row.change.map(signed) ?? row.closing.map(money) ?? "—").font(CuadraoTypography.rowAmount)` and the checkpoint caption rule (caption only when `row.change != nil` or `row.closing == nil`); drop `startingBalance`, the "Sin inicio registrado" branch and the `CuadraoMissingCoverage.amount` fallback.

Reason: `CuadraoSpaceSelectorLayout` is the checkpoint `HStack(spacing: 4) { ScrollViewReader { ScrollView(.horizontal) { HStack(spacing: 24) ... }.scrollIndicators(.hidden).onChange(of: selection) { proxy.scrollTo } }; CuadraoSectionAddButton }` with `addTitle` "Añadir o gestionar espacios" and id `cuadrao-spaces-add` supplied by the Preview wrapper. `CuadraoSpaceLabel` keeps `.subheadline` semibold/regular, primary/secondary, `minHeight: 44`, `contentShape`. Per-space `Button`, `.id(space.id)`, `.isSelected` trait and id `cuadrao-space-<id>` unchanged. The earlier audit's "rewrite" is an extraction with no rendering change.

Class: UNSURE SEAM/DRIFT
Used by: no connected file reads `adaptsToAppearance`; every Cuadrao view reads the tokens (9746bb602)
Reason: `WelcomePalette.adaptsToAppearance` was `CuadraoDesignPreview.isActive` (DEBUG also `--cuadrao-release-ui`) and is now the constant `true`; the `fixed` light `Color` argument of each `adaptive` token is dropped. For the design-preview launch (`isActive == true`) every token already resolved through the `UIColor { trait }` path, and the light values of the dropped `fixed` colors equal the `light` UIColors (pine 0.16/0.29/0.25, moneyInput 0.18/0.47/0.40, sage 0.91/0.93/0.91, overlap 0.25/0.38/0.33, owedNegative 0.68/0.36/0.26, background white, surface 0.965, ink 0.08, onAccent white), so the Preview app renders byte-identical: SEAM. For any launch where `isActive` was `false` (the Xcode `#Preview("Home · First use") { CuadraoHomeCanvas().preferredColorScheme(.light) }` macros at the bottom of CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift, UI tests without the flag, and the connected app) the tokens were fixed and are now adaptive, which changes light mode for three tokens (`separator`: `Color(white: 0.85)` to `.separator` at 0.45 opacity; `border`: `Color(white: 0.80)` to `.separator`; `disabledInk`: `Color(white: 0.43)` to `Color.secondary`) and turns on the dark-appearance palette everywhere. The checkpoint comment "Every other launch, including Connected Cuadrao, keeps the shipped light tokens exactly" is deleted with it. If the founder counts the Xcode canvas previews as the Preview, this is DRIFT; if only the flagged app counts, SEAM with a connected-side rendering change the owner should accept explicitly.
Restore: Put back the `isActive`-gated `adaptsToAppearance` and the three-argument `adaptive(_ fixed:, _ light:, _ dark:)` with `guard adaptsToAppearance else { return fixed }`.

Used by: Connected/ConnectedCuadraoShell.swift:43
Reason: Extracted from CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift checkpoint lines 9 (`reduceMotion`), 28 (`pendingTab`), 37 (`navigationBarHeight`), 47 (`TabView(selection: tabSelection)`), 98-139 (`.cuadraoScrollBar` bottom bar with `CuadraoVoiceBar`, `CuadraoNavigationBar` in a 72pt ZStack with 64pt frame, horizontal 20, bottom 8, `.easeOut(0.18)` fade on recording; `.cuadraoSoftScrollEdges`; `.cuadraoVoicePresentation`; the temporary-chat `confirmationDialog`; `.tint(pine).foregroundStyle(ink)`), 143 (`.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)`) and 176-184 (`tabSelection`). Sub-items:

#### Hunk 1a: shell structure, bottom bar, voice presentation, dialog, tint
Class: SEAM
Reason: Verbatim, same strings and constants. `showsNavigation` and `compact` are computed by the caller from the checkpoint expressions.

#### Hunk 1b: `showProposal: (() -> Void)? = nil` (6f30bf2f9)
Class: SEAM
Reason: Optional so the connected shell can hide "Show example proposal"; the canvas passes `{ voiceProposal = .proposed }` and the shell wraps it with the checkpoint's `selection = .plan; chat.voice.presentation = .compact`. Preview behavior unchanged.

#### Hunk 1c: `.font(.body)` on the TabView (line 64, e6b7cf325 "restore the complete connected Cuadrao shell", no body text)
Class: UNSURE SEAM/DRIFT
Reason: The checkpoint root had no `.font` modifier (no `font(.body)` in CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift, CuadraoCanvas.swift or CuadraoDesignPreview.swift at the checkpoint). An explicit body font in the environment is a no-op for text that already defaults to body, but SwiftUI surfaces that pick a smaller default only when the environment carries no font (List section headers in the Profile and Search tab canvases, which use `Section`) can restyle. I could not render to confirm. If any such header or label changes, DRIFT; otherwise SEAM.
Restore: Delete the `.font(.body)` line; nothing in the Preview depended on it.

#### Hunk 1d: `.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)` scoped to the TabView (line 67)
Class: SEAM here, DRIFT in CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift Hunk 5c
Reason: Setting the environment inside the shell is fine for tab content; the drift is the canvas no longer setting it above its own `.sheet` / `.receiptPresentation`.

The UNSURE column is added to the contract's four because four items hinge on a rendering I could not observe without a build; each names both candidate classes above.

## Highest-impact DRIFT

1. **CuadraoHomeCanvas.swift Hunk 5c.** "Preguntar a Cuadrao" from a receipt review and from an account opened inside the Novedades sheet now does nothing in the Preview: the `cuadraoChat` environment moved inside the shell and no longer reaches the canvas's `.sheet` / `.receiptPresentation`. Restore the `.environment(\.cuadraoChat, chat)` on the canvas root after `.environment(\.receiptWorkspace, ...)`.
2. **CuadraoBalanceBreakdown.swift Hunk 4.** Expanded Balance "What changed" rows: an account with no balance shows "Sin datos" instead of "—", and an account added mid-period shows "Sin datos" with the new caption "Sin inicio registrado" instead of its closing balance. Reachable by interaction, not by fixtures. Restore the checkpoint `accountValue` or gate the new wording behind a defaulted flag.
3. **CuadraoCanvas.swift Hunk 1 (UNSURE).** Palette always adapts. Flagged Preview launch is unchanged; Xcode `#Preview` canvases, unflagged UI-test launches and the connected app now get `.separator`-based separators and borders, `Color.secondary` disabled ink, and the dark palette in dark mode.
4. **CuadraoAppShell.swift Hunk 1c (UNSURE).** `.font(.body)` on the shell root was not at the checkpoint; it can restyle List section headers in the Profile and Search tabs. Delete it unless a rendering check shows nothing moved.
5. **CuadraoHomePresentation.swift, `CuadraoBalanceAmount` (i).** VoiceOver reads "DOP 1,500.00" for the hero amount instead of "1,500.00". No visual change. Delete the `.accessibilityLabel` on `amountLabel` to restore.
6. **CuadraoHomePresentation.swift, `CuadraoFeedRow` and `CuadraoBalanceAmount` (ii) (UNSURE FIX/DRIFT).** At accessibility type sizes the amount drops under the detail line (feed rows) and under the currency row (hero). Default size is byte-identical. FIX if the checkpoint truncated at AX sizes; verify at AX5 before keeping or reverting.

Suspects from the earlier audit that are not DRIFT in these files: `!period.changes.isEmpty` (never flips in the Preview; `changes` is empty only when `accounts` is empty, and then `closing` is already nil), `historical:` in CuadraoHomeInsights (untouched), `showProposal` default (canvas passes its closure), the voice proposal path (same three statements in the same order), `CuadraoHomeEmptyState` and `CuadraoSpaceSelector` (extractions with identical strings and modifiers).

# A clarification reply keeps what the user already said

Lane branch `claude/dca-clarification-retention-1578cd`, base integration
`46d43c1d` (`origin/codex/private-alpha-next` on 2026-09-11). Fix commits
`368fe918`, `ee15a349` (Codex round 1), `a658c7ad` (Codex round 2) and
`1d41d9f4` (Codex round 3). This folder holds the reproduction on the base, the deterministic
replay of the recorded provider reads before and after, the live browser demo
in English and Spanish before and after, the two new measurement cases run
live, the engine check of the start-day contribution, and every billed cost.

## The recorded turns (2026-09-10, English workspace)

1. "Test monthly dollar-cost averaging in DOCN from September 10, 2025 through
   September 9, 2026. Start with $1,000 of starting capital, then contribute
   $100 every month. The $1,000 is starting capital, not a total contribution
   cap. Compare with SPY. Model a 10 basis point fee and 5 basis points
   slippage per trade." Argus asked which direction to go because it could
   not treat the $1,000 as both starting capital and a cap.
2. "Use $1,000 as starting capital only. There is no contribution cap. Add
   $100 monthly after the initial investment. Keep the dates, SPY benchmark,
   10 bps fee and 5 bps slippage." Argus replied "Got it — ..." and asked for
   the asset and the date window again.

## Reproduction on the base (`46d43c1d`)

### Live, three runs of the two turns in-process (`live/before_en*.json`)

The runtime, the interpreter and every audit ran against the live models and
the live asset catalog (`drivers` in the scratch folder; provider payloads are
stripped of the prompt text). The recorded reads did not come back on demand:

| Run | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| 1 | Card, **starting capital $0** (the seed was dropped: the primary read typed `initial_capital: 1000` with no provenance map and the projection discarded it) | Card, $1,000 after the restatement was applied as an edit | $0.069 |
| 2 | Card, $1,000 | "The visible confirmation is still ready." | $0.053 |
| 3 | Card, **starting capital $0** (same loss) | Card, $1,000 | $0.052 |

The recorded clarification about a cap did not appear in three runs; the
same head dropped the $1,000 seed in two of them. Both losses are the same
class: a deterministic layer deciding a money role on its own.

### Deterministic replay of the recorded reads (`replay/`)

`replay_<variant>.json` runs the real LangGraph runtime (memory checkpointer,
live asset catalog, no model cost) with every structured provider call
answered by the recorded shapes: the primary read with the seed typed
explicitly, `DcaContributionRoleAudit` = `recurring_contribution_explicit:
true, total_budget_not_recurring: true`, and on turn 2 a transport error on
the primary, a fallback read without asset or dates, `FocusedStrategyExtraction`
with `date_range: null` and `FocusedDateWindowExtraction` with
`has_date_window: false`. The variant is what `DcaContractAudit` said about
the $1,000.

| `DcaContractAudit` budget read | Turn 1 before | Turn 2 before | Turn 1 after | Turn 2 after |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| none | card | **re-asks asset and dates**, reply shows the em dash | card, seed $1,000 | card, seed $1,000 |
| $1,000 as `starting_capital` | **cap clarification** (`unsupported_dca_contribution_ceiling`) | re-asks asset and dates | card, seed $1,000 | card, seed $1,000 |
| $1,000 as `cap` | cap clarification | re-asks asset and dates | card, seed $1,000 | card, seed $1,000 |
| $1,000 as `total_budget` | cap clarification | re-asks asset and dates | card, seed $1,000 | card, seed $1,000 |

Turn 1 before: any budget read, even one the audit itself labels
"starting_capital", was written under the `total_budget` key beside the
explicit `initial_capital`, and the semantic reader refused the plan as
capped. Turn 2 before: the merge that carries the pending setup only fired
when the model labeled the turn a continuation or a `requested_field` was
set, and an unsupported-recovery question sets neither, so the facts were
lost even in the variant whose turn 1 had reached a card.
`replay_hermetic.json` is the same replay with the synthetic fixture (AAPL),
where the interpreter's benchmark-misplacement repair also put SPY into the
asset universe on turn 2; that repair's own receipt now marks the artifact so
the merge ignores it. That replay is a committed test.

## What changed

- `src/argus/agent_runtime/stages/interpret_internal/shared.py`:
  `_turn_continues_pending_setup`. The runtime asked (the previous stage
  awaited the user) and a pending strategy exists, so the reply continues that
  setup whatever act the interpreter labeled it, with one exception: an
  explicit fresh-task read (`new_idea` and `new_task`) starts clean whatever
  the draft holds, complete or not, and what it lacks is asked for rather
  than inherited. That pair has one owner, `is_explicit_fresh_task` in
  `interpreter/shared.py`, read by this predicate and by the act owner, and
  the stage's act set is the owner's `KNOWN_TURN_ACTS`.
  `_pending_setup_continuation_reason_codes` records the override as
  `pending_setup_continuation_merged`.
- `interpreter/shared.py`: `repaired_turn_act`, the one owner of the act a
  repaired read carries. A known act is the model's read and stays; an act a
  repair replaces (none, `unsupported_request`) is decided by whether the
  runtime is waiting on its own question, and that assumption is recorded as
  `pending_setup_reply_assumed_without_model_read`. The focused strategy
  repair, the DCA contract audit and the seedless fallback read it; the
  prose override keeps the act it was handed. The focused re-read's base is
  the pending draft only for a turn that answers the runtime's question; a
  fresh task is re-read from itself alone.
- `contextual_merge.py`: the merge gate reads that predicate; an incoming
  asset universe that holds only the benchmark repair's artifact does not
  replace the pending asset. `asset_resolution.py`: the hidden-context guard, which clears an
  asset a new idea did not name, does not run on a continuation.
- `interpreter/dca_audits.py`: an audit may add a money role only for a
  distinct amount, and the role it names decides the field. A seed the user
  typed is never re-typed as a cap (`dca_budget_audit_outranked_by_typed_seed`);
  the same money read again as the seed adds no role when the draft typed it
  as a cap (`dca_budget_audit_same_amount_already_typed`) and supplies the
  provenance the primary left out when two reads agree on the seed
  (`dca_budget_audit_seed_corroborated`);
  a budget the audit calls starting capital lands in `initial_capital` only
  while that role is empty (`dca_budget_audit_typed_as_seed`); beside an
  occupied seed it can only bound the plan, so it becomes the ceiling
  (`dca_budget_audit_seed_role_occupied_read_as_ceiling`); beside a cap the
  primary mis-slotted under the seed key it keeps its seed role
  (`dca_budget_audit_seed_role_kept_beside_misplaced_cap`) and the reader
  places both by role; a distinct cap is
  still a ceiling. The role names come from `DCA_SEED_ROLES` and
  `DCA_CEILING_ROLES` in `argus/domain/dca_capital.py`.
  `_seed_corroborated_by_fidelity_audit`: a seed the primary typed without
  provenance keeps its value when the fidelity audit reads the same distinct
  starting capital beside the contribution (`stated_run_field_seed_corroborated`).
- `semantic_integrity.py`: a ceiling key whose provenance names a seed role is
  read as the seed when it is the seed's own money, a lone or an equal amount
  (`semantic_dca_seed_role_read_over_ceiling_key`); a distinct amount stays a
  ceiling. A seed key whose provenance names a ceiling role is read as the
  ceiling (`semantic_dca_ceiling_role_read_over_seed_key`). When both slots
  are crossed with distinct money, each amount moves to the slot its role
  names and both codes are recorded; the same money in both crossed slots is
  one fact and reads as the cap, never as a day-one seed.
- `src/argus/api/chat/visible_reply.py`: the one owner of the em dash rule at
  the point a reply becomes visible. Token frames, the final payload text and
  the persisted message pass through it; the turn records `reply_rewrites`
  (`docs/API_CONTRACT.md`). A dash set directly between two figures
  ("5%—10%", "$1,000—$2,000") is the model's range notation and keeps a
  hyphen in every language; a figure character is a digit, any Unicode
  currency sign or a percent-like sign, on either side of the dash, nothing
  enumerated. Every other dash takes the comma, colon or period the copy
  rule asks for.
- `tests/evals/measurement_eval_harness.py`: a followup turn runs against the
  setup the first turn built (the workflow's own snapshot builder), not
  against an absent snapshot.
- No model-facing text changed; `tests/test_interpreter_prompt_freeze.py`
  passes and the fingerprint is untouched.

## Tests

| Suite | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| `tests/agent_runtime/test_pending_setup_continuation.py` (fields × families × labels × en/es-419, the fresh-task escape, the act owner's invariant table, the focused re-read of a fresh task and of a continuing new idea, the recorded two turns through the real workflow) | 101 passed |
| `tests/agent_runtime/test_dca_money_role_audits.py` | 35 passed |
| `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (owner + SSE and persistence contract) | 46 passed |
| `tests/evals/test_measurement_eval_followup_snapshot.py` | 2 passed |
| Hermetic `tests/agent_runtime`, `tests/evals`, `tests/test_spine_guardrails.py`, `test_interpreter_prompt_freeze.py`, `test_visible_reply.py` at the merge head `6ed5d458` | 2698 passed, 2 skipped |
| `tests/domain`, `tests/context`, `tests/test_alpha_api.py`, the chat stream and action contracts, OpenAPI compatibility, the DCA readout, the release docs at the merge head `6ed5d458` | 822 passed |
| `scripts/check_modularity_budget.py` | no violations |

## Measurement cases, run live on the fix (`live_cases_after.json`)

`dca_capital_semantics_clarification_reply_keeps_earlier_facts_2026_09_10`
and its Spanish twin, typed assertions only (no judge): both **passed**.
Turn 1 reached the card with DOCN, 2025-09-10 to 2026-09-09, SPY, seed
$1,000, contribution $100 monthly, fee 0.001 and slippage 0.0005 with
`explicit_user` provenance, so the harness did not need the followup. Billed
$0.068 for both. The full suite ran afterwards on the round-1 head, below.

## Browser demo (`browser/`)

Real chat UI at `localhost:3000` under mock auth, backend on `:8000` with live
market data, live models. "Before" is the base tree served from a detached
worktree at `46d43c1d`; "after" is the lane head. The Spanish runs switched
the profile language to `es-419` first.

| Run | Turn 1 | Turn 2 | Screenshots | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| before, en | Card with **Starting capital $0** | Card with $1,000 (restatement applied as an edit) | `before-en-turn1.png`, `before-en-turn2.png` | $0.055 |
| before, es-419 | Card, capital inicial $1,000 | Card, $1,000 | `before-es-419-turn1.png`, `before-es-419-turn2.png` | $0.078 |
| after, en | Card, starting capital $1,000 | Card unchanged, $1,000; the runtime says no changes were applied | `after-en-turn1.png`, `after-en-turn2.png` | $0.069 |
| after, es-419 | Card, capital inicial $1,000 | "La confirmación visible sigue lista." | `after-es-419-turn1.png`, `after-es-419-turn2.png` | $0.043 |

No em dash was shown in any of the eight turns; the models did not write one
this time, so `reply_rewrites` never fired in the demo. Its behavior is
covered by `tests/test_visible_reply.py`. The base run reproduced the seed
loss in the browser (English) and not the cap clarification, consistent with
the in-process runs above.

## The start-day $100 (`engine/docn-dca-flows.txt`)

The engine was run directly on live DOCN bars for the recorded plan ($1,000
seed, $100 monthly, 10 bps fee, 5 bps slippage). The stored external flows
put **$1,100 on 2025-09-10**: the seed plus a $100 contribution on the first
bar, then $100 on the first trading day of each month through 2026-09-01.
That is 13 entries and $2,300 invested, exactly the recorded run. This is
engine semantics in `_dca_equity_curve` and `signals.py` (an entry lands on
the first bar of every window, including the window the run opens in), not
an interpretation defect. The user said the $100 starts after the initial
investment; the engine does not distinguish that. Not changed in this lane.

## Codex round 1 (four P1 findings on `2a1be28d`, fixed in `ee15a349`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |

Hermetic sweeps at `ee15a349`: 2308 passed (`tests/agent_runtime`, spine guardrails) and 980 passed (chat stream contract, prompt freeze, mocked evals, alpha API, `tests/domain`). No modularity violations, prompt fingerprint untouched.

## Full live measurement at `ee15a349` (`live-measurement.json`, `baseline-comparison.json`)

The sanctioned pre-merge gate for a runtime-behavior change (tests/evals/README.md,
Test Tiers), run once on the round-1 head with a clean worktree,
`ARGUS_MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER_MODE` and `ARGUS_ASSET_PROVIDER_MODE` assigned to
`live_provider` in the process environment, the live asset catalog and the
calendar probe passing. 71 cases, 64 passed, 7 failed, no infrastructure
errors, $1.41 billed, 40 minutes. Compared case by case against the
fingerprint's baseline, `docs/reports/evidence/decision-10/live-measurement.json`
(63 passed, 6 failed at `60e7c0ec`), with `drivers/compare_baseline.py`:

| Verdict | Count | Cases |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| unchanged | 58 | 57 passing both times, plus `asset_discovery_not_result_followup_issue_244`, the known open bug (#590) |
| fixed | 5 | `asset_discovery_category_spanish_issue_244` and `asset_discovery_old_pharma_escalation_exact_issue_344` (the baseline's synthetic-market-data failures, now on live data), `dca_capital_semantics_prebaked_chip_spanish_pesos_reaches_ready_to_run`, `graceful_recovery_spanish_weekly_options_aapl`, `ordinary_conversation_concept_compound_interest_en` |
| added | 2 | the two recorded-repro cases, both passed |
| regressed | 6 | see below |

The six "regressed" verdicts were each rerun once, alone, with the prose judge
on (`rerun-regressed-cases.json`, $0.08): all six passed. Their first-run
failure modes were provider-side. `action_chip_add_asset_preserves_modeled_costs_issue_271`
and `dca_capital_semantics_truncated_window_measures_served_issue_455` ended in
`coverage_recovery` with `market_data_unavailable` from the market-data
preflight (MSFT/AAPL and RDDT). `dca_capital_semantics_explicit_cap_refused_by_name_issue_455`
hit a 20-second grok timeout and then a haiku response that failed schema
validation, so the seedless focused repair ran, and that path has no field for
a plan-wide cap; eight grok timeouts landed in the run overall.
`asset_discovery_peer_anchor_english_issue_244` and
`ordinary_conversation_price_question_en` were prose-judge honesty verdicts.
`action_chip_change_asset_compound_replace_issue_188` was answered as a
conversation follow-up on the first run and as the expected compound edit on
the rerun. No case failed on a typed check that this lane's code owns.

Observed, not changed: after both interpretation candidates fail, the
seedless focused-extraction repair cannot carry a plan-wide cap, so a "don't
invest more than" statement is lost on that path.

The prompt fingerprint is untouched; `tests/test_interpreter_prompt_freeze.py`
passes at this head, so the fingerprint's own `last_measured` is not moved.

## Codex round 2 (a P1 and a P2 on `b1e506ea`, fixed in `a658c7ad`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "New idea: DCA $200 monthly into AAPL during 2025" read as a new idea and a new task still merged with the pending AAPL setup because the symbol did not change, so the card inherited the $1,000 seed, fees and slippage | An explicit fresh-task read wins over asset equality: a new idea that names another traded asset, or that states a complete task on its own (the contract's own required-fields owner decides), starts clean. Only a partial new-idea read while the runtime awaits a reply is that reply | `test_an_explicit_fresh_task_on_the_same_asset_does_not_inherit_the_pending_setup` (en, es-419); the continuation matrix now skips complete fresh-task reads under the same owner |
| An em dash arriving as its own stream chunk was dropped with no replacement, so the live reply read "Hello world" while the saved reply read "Hello, world" | `ReplyRewrites.token` holds a chunk's trailing boundary characters (spaces, dashes) for the next chunk and rewrites a chunk that opens on a dash against the text already shown, so live and persisted text are the same | `test_streamed_chunks_render_exactly_what_the_final_reply_persists` (English and Spanish chunkings, punctuation and line-start cases) |

### The haiku path for `dca_capital_semantics_explicit_cap_refused_by_name_issue_455` (`haiku-check/`)

In the full live run this case failed after grok timed out and haiku answered
the interpretation (executable, starting capital 0.0). Its rerun passed on
grok and never exercised that path. With `ARGUS_STRUCTURED_MODEL` and
`ARGUS_STRUCTURED_FALLBACK_MODEL` set to `anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5` in the
process environment (`drivers/haiku_case.py`), three runs each:

| Tree | Attempt 1 | Attempt 2 | Attempt 3 | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ---: |
| `origin/codex/private-alpha-next` at `46d43c1d` | passed, ceiling refused | **failed, executable, starting capital 0.0** | passed, ceiling refused | $0.076 |
| this head (`ee15a349` code) | passed, ceiling refused | passed, ceiling refused | passed, ceiling refused | $0.089 |

This PR does not change the outcome for the worse: the integration base
already loses the cap one time in three when haiku reads the interpretation,
and this head held it three times. The loss is haiku's read of the cap, not
a layer this lane owns; no code change was made for it.

### Measurement cases the round-2 fix touches, live at `a658c7ad` (`live-touched-cases-a658c7ad.json`)

The continuation rule change reaches every case where a reply arrives while a
setup is pending: the two recorded-repro cases (en, es-419), the two prebaked
chip followups (en, es-419) and `action_chip_change_asset_no_active_ref_fresh_idea_issue_188`,
the fresh idea stated during a pending clarification. All five passed with the
judge on, $0.19. The em dash change touches no measurement case; it lives in
the SSE and persistence boundary that `tests/test_visible_reply.py` covers.

### Measurement cases the round-3 fix touches, live at `1d41d9f4` (`live-touched-cases-1d41d9f4.json`)

The money-role change reaches every DCA case that states a seed or a cap:
`dca_capital_semantics_only_have_amount_is_ceiling_issue_455`,
`dca_capital_semantics_explicit_cap_refused_by_name_issue_455`,
`dca_capital_semantics_stated_seed_reaches_ready_to_run_issue_455`,
`dca_capital_semantics_spanish_seed_and_contribution_issue_455` and the two
recorded-repro cases (en, es-419). All six passed with the judge on, $0.13.
The stream flush touches no measurement case; the SSE contract test covers it.

The same class swept: the focused strategy repair, the DCA contract audit and the seedless fallback each relabeled the act on their own; the act now has one owner, `interpreter/shared.repaired_turn_act` (a known act is the model's read and stays; an act a repair replaces is decided by the runtime's own pending question and recorded as `pending_setup_reply_assumed_without_model_read`) | `test_a_partial_fresh_task_read_stays_fresh_and_asks_for_what_it_lacks` (en, es-419), `test_a_repair_keeps_a_known_act_and_decides_a_replaced_one_from_the_pending_state` |

### Measurement cases the round-4 fix touches, live at `506b38a7` (`live-touched-cases-506b38a7.json`)

The fresh-task rule and the act owner reach every case that answers a pending
setup or opens a fresh idea beside one: the two recorded-repro cases (en,
es-419), the two prebaked-chip followups, and
`action_chip_change_asset_no_active_ref_fresh_idea_issue_188`. The money-role
change reaches the four DCA seed-or-cap cases again. All nine passed with the
judge on, $0.32.

Beside the user's own seed the round-1 rule stands | `test_a_seed_the_audit_reads_keeps_its_role_beside_a_cap_in_the_seed_slot` |

### Measurement cases the round-5 fix touches, live at `8241f56d` (`live-touched-cases-8241f56d.json`)

The same nine cases as round 4 (the focused re-read serves the recorded
repros and the chip followups; the writer serves the four DCA seed-or-cap

| The primary typed the $5,000 cap under `initial_capital` with a ceiling role and the audit repeated the same $5,000 as starting capital; the round-5 branch kept the audit's seed role and the crossed-slot reader invented a $5,000 day-one seed beside the $5,000 ceiling | The invariant the writer already states decides it: an audit adds a role only for a distinct amount. The same money read again as the seed adds no role (`dca_budget_audit_same_amount_already_typed`); the draft's own typing stands and the reader places the mis-slotted cap as the ceiling with no seed. The round-5 keep-role branch is reached only by a distinct amount; a repeated cap reading still lands as the ceiling (round 3) | `test_an_audit_that_repeats_a_mis_slotted_cap_as_the_seed_adds_no_role` |

### Measurement cases the round-6 fix touches, live at `cda7a1a3` (`live-touched-cases-cda7a1a3.json`)

The same nine cases. All nine passed with the judge on, $0.28.

## Codex round 7 (two P1s on `e90f52af`, fixed in `ef6b38a1`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The primary typed the $1,000 seed with no provenance and the contract audit read the same $1,000 as starting capital; the round-6 no-role branch recorded nothing, `_grounded_initial_capital` dropped the untyped seed and the run started from zero | The no-role reading is kept only for money the draft typed as a cap. Otherwise two reads that agree on the seed corroborate it: the audit supplies the provenance the primary left out (`dca_budget_audit_seed_corroborated`), as the fidelity audit already did (`stated_run_field_seed_corroborated`) | `test_a_contract_audit_that_reads_the_untyped_seed_supplies_its_provenance` |
| The primary put the same $5,000 in both crossed slots (`initial_capital` under a ceiling role, `total_capital` under a seed role); the round-4 swap moved both and the report carried a $5,000 ceiling beside an invented $5,000 seed | The swap needs distinct money. Equal money is one fact and falls through to the rule for a cap in the seed slot (a ceiling, never money on day one); a cap already moved out of the seed slot is never read back as a seed | `test_semantic_reader_reads_an_equal_amount_in_both_crossed_slots_as_one_cap` |

### Measurement cases the round-7 fix touches, live at `ef6b38a1` (`live-touched-cases-ef6b38a1.json`, `live-rerun-only-have-ef6b38a1.json`)

The same nine cases, $0.29. Eight passed with the judge on. In
`dca_capital_semantics_only_have_amount_is_ceiling_issue_455` grok timed out
on the primary read and haiku's fallback read "through 2024" as an end date
only, so the runtime asked for the period before it could refuse the cap
(`missing_period`); the money fields never held the shape this round
changed. Rerun alone with grok on the primary it passed ($0.03).

## Codex round 8 (one P1 on `5327ad23`, fixed in `f7fc6d74`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The act owner treated every `new_idea` as fresh while the stage predicate treated only `new_idea` with `new_task` as fresh, so a date-only reply the model labelled `new_idea`/`continue` lost its pending base in the focused re-read and fell to unsupported recovery | One owner for the pair: `is_explicit_fresh_task` in `interpreter/shared.py`; `repaired_turn_act` and `_turn_continues_pending_setup` both derive from it, and the stage's act set is the owner's `KNOWN_TURN_ACTS` | the act owner's table gains the `new_idea`/`continue` row; `test_a_focused_repair_of_a_date_only_reply_read_as_a_continuing_new_idea_keeps_the_pending_setup` (en, es-419) |

### Measurement cases the round-8 fix touches, live at `f7fc6d74` (`live-touched-cases-f7fc6d74.json`)

The continuation cases only (the money-role code is untouched this round):
the two recorded repros (en, es-419), the two prebaked-chip followups and
`action_chip_change_asset_no_active_ref_fresh_idea_issue_188`. All five
passed with the judge on, $0.17.

## Codex round 9 (one P1 on `416e7348`, not changed)

| Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| An audit that reports a cap equal to the seed the user typed (`total_budget_source="cap"`) is outranked by the typed seed, so an equal-valued cap stated separately would not be refused | Rejected with evidence. The equal amount beside a typed seed is the recorded turn-1 defect (the audit returned the typed $1,000 seed as `total_budget_amount`; the clarifier asked about a cap the user had ruled out). The lane's rule is that an explicit user statement about an amount outranks an audit's guess, and an audit adds a role only for a distinct amount; `test_budget_audit_cannot_re_role_money_the_user_typed_as_the_seed` covers the "cap" and "total_budget" roles since round 1. The suppression is recorded on every turn (`dca_budget_audit_outranked_by_typed_seed`). Honoring an equal-amount cap over the typed seed is a product call for the founder |

The round-8 fix head also gained the modularity budget entry for the grown
continuation test file (`416e7348`), which the budget test in CI requires.

## Codex round 10 (one P1 on `46e64dcf`, fixed in `87874f01`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The em dash owner replaced every dash with a comma, so a model's range notation ("5%—10%", "$1,000—$2,000") read as two separate figures, live and persisted | A dash set directly between two figures, no space on either side, keeps a hyphen in every language; a spaced dash between figures is still an aside and takes the comma. The stream path already holds a chunk's trailing dash and reads the shown tail as its left side, so a range split across chunks renders exactly what is persisted | whole-reply and chunked ranges in English and Spanish, and a spaced dash keeping the comma, in `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (seven failed on the head owner) |

This owner touches no measurement case; no live run and no spend.

## Codex round 11 (one P1 on `ab0fac18`, fixed in `5b881d13`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The range rule named three currency signs, so a yen or rupee range was still rendered as two figures | A figure opens with a digit or any character of Unicode category Sc and closes with a digit or a sign Unicode names as a percent or per-mille sign; nothing is enumerated | yen, rupee and per-mille ranges, whole-reply in English and Spanish and chunked, in `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (four failed on the head owner) |

This owner touches no measurement case; no live run and no spend.

## Codex round 12 (one P1 on `26617dac`, fixed in `35423df9`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A currency sign placed after the amount ("1.000€—2.000€") was not accepted as a figure ending, so the range was rendered as two figures | One predicate says what a figure character is (a digit, any Unicode currency sign, or a percent-like sign) and both sides of the dash use it | trailing-sign ranges in Spanish and English, whole-reply and chunked, and a letter code that keeps the comma, in `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (three failed on the head owner) |

This owner touches no measurement case; no live run and no spend.

## Codex round 13 (one P2 on `73d8bdde`, fixed in `971fdbc6`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adjacent dashes ("Wait——actually") streamed as "Wait, actually" and persisted as "Wait. actually", because the empty text between them was read as the end of a streamed token | A run of adjacent dashes is one dash, collapsed before the split, so both doors read the same text; every dash is still counted | adjacent dashes whole-reply in English and Spanish and split across chunks on either side, in `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (five failed on the head owner) |

This owner touches no measurement case; no live run and no spend.

## Codex round 14 (one P2 on `ca85091d`, fixed in `b14a0c1e`)

| Finding | Fix | Test |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dashes separated only by spaces ("Wait— —actually") still split into a blank interior piece that the stream read as a token end and the final reply as a sentence end | After the split, blank interior pieces are dropped, so any run of dashes with nothing but spaces between them is one dash on both doors; every dash is still counted | spaced dash runs whole-reply in English and Spanish and chunked, in `tests/test_visible_reply.py` (four failed on the head owner) |

This owner touches no measurement case; no live run and no spend.

## Full live measurement at `6ed5d458` (`live-measurement-6ed5d458.json`, `baseline-comparison-6ed5d458.json`)

The pre-merge gate rerun on the merge head: `origin/codex/private-alpha-next`
at `2623e33a` (#592 landed) merged into the lane with no conflicts, the
focused suites and the hermetic sweeps green (agent_runtime + evals + spine
2698 passed, contract 822 passed), a clean worktree, both provider modes
assigned to `live_provider` in the process environment, the live asset
catalog and the calendar probe passing (a first attempt stopped at the door
on an Alpaca 504 before any model call; nothing spent). 71 cases, 65 passed,
6 failed, no infrastructure errors, $1.50 billed, 49 minutes; 12
structured-tier timeouts landed in the run (11 grok primary or audit reads
and one asset-mention read). Compared case by case against the fingerprint's
baseline, `docs/reports/evidence/decision-10/live-measurement.json` (63
passed, 6 failed at `60e7c0ec`):

| Verdict | Count | Cases |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| unchanged | 61 | 59 passing both times, plus `asset_discovery_old_pharma_escalation_exact_issue_344` (`discovery_search_failed`, the baseline's known failure) and `dca_capital_semantics_prebaked_chip_spanish_pesos_reaches_ready_to_run` (see below) |
| fixed | 4 | `asset_discovery_category_spanish_issue_244`, `asset_discovery_not_result_followup_issue_244` (#590, landed in #592), `graceful_recovery_spanish_weekly_options_aapl`, `ordinary_conversation_concept_compound_interest_en` |
| added | 2 | the two recorded-repro cases, both passed |
| regressed | 4 | see below |

Each flip, with the structured-tier timeouts recorded in its own route
receipts, and the one allowed rerun alone with the judge on
(`live-rerun-regressed-6ed5d458.json`, $0.06):

| Case | First run | Structured-tier timeouts | Rerun alone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `action_chip_change_asset_bare_ticker_append_issue_190` | `conversation_followup`, TSLA not appended; the act was `answer_pending_need` (this lane's fresh-task rule never fired) and the artifact edit plan needed the haiku fallback after grok | none | passed |
| `capability_honesty_future_performance_btc_regression` | `research.published` false | none | passed |
| `capability_honesty_future_performance_nvda_golden_cross` | `research.published` false | none | passed |
| `messy_spanish_future_performance_nvda_cruce_dorado` | `research.published` false with `research_unavailable_timeout` (the research provider timed out) and two prose-judge verdicts on the unresearched reply | `LLMInterpretationResponse@x-ai/grok-4.3` (haiku answered) | failed again: five sources returned, the publisher withheld the answer as `scenario_inputs_uncited`, prose judge passed |

The persistent Spanish failure is the research publisher's own gate on an
answer whose scenario inputs were not cited, a path this lane does not touch;
the base's #592 scorecard at `b7bdca4e` also failed this case, in a different
mode. `dca_capital_semantics_prebaked_chip_spanish_pesos_reaches_ready_to_run`
failed in the full run because turn 1's clarifier was unavailable (deepseek
timeout, two qwen validation errors, offline fallback) and turn 2's bare
"13,000 pesos" then came back as an ambiguous plan-wide amount with the two
role options; it passed in all five touched-case runs of rounds 4 to 8 and
passed alone here (`live-rerun-pesos-6ed5d458.json`, $0.06). No case failed on
a typed check this lane's code owns.

The prompt fingerprint is untouched; `tests/test_interpreter_prompt_freeze.py`
passes at this head, so the fingerprint's own `last_measured` is not moved.

## Observed, not changed here

- The turn-2 restatement on a ready card is answered with "No requested
  changes were applied. Please restate what you want to change." (en) or
  "La confirmación visible sigue lista." (es-419). Both are truthful and keep
  the card; neither re-asks a fact.
- The persisted content of that Spanish reply is the English recovery text
  while the UI renders the localized copy from typed metadata.

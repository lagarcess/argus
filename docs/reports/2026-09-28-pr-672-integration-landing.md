## Outcome and remaining work

Docs-only accuracy audit against current integration and founder authority.
Kept still-valid corrections (calculation catalog ownership, memory/sharing
production truth, decision-log locks, promotion deploy proof). Dropped the
draft Wave 1 roadmap revival. Durable promotion evidence lives under
`docs/reports/evidence/2026-09-17-main-promotion/`. Founder execution-board
ownership and revenue/pricing deferral ship in place via
`docs/DOCUMENTATION_AUTHORITY.md` (no separate status PR).

No code, config, workflow, migration, or environment-template changes.
No deployment or `main` promotion. No linked issue auto-close.

## Accepted evidence

- Exact-head CI on `0b534d00` before merge (`docs-checks`, ownership/docs
  gates, aggregate `ci` success; backend/frontend/guest/local-smoke skipped
  as docs-only).
- Codex clean on `0b534d00` at 21:38:48Z; 0 unresolved review threads;
  0 commits behind integration; `mergeable_state: clean`.
- Clearer READY handoff naming tip `0b534d00`.

## Documentation and environment audit

This landing adds the integration register entry and this report. Product
docs and board text already shipped inside #672. `.env.example` /
`web/.env.local.example` / `render.yaml` unchanged. No secrets inspected or
rewritten. `git diff --check` clean for the squash vs parent.

## Authority boundary

This checkpoint stops at `codex/private-alpha-next`. No main promotion,
deployment, hosted Blueprint sync, tester exposure, or merge of any other PR
is part of this landing. #723 remains HOLD (asset-listing lane owns final
audit); #725 remains LANDING HOLD; #646 and #634 were not touched.

# Spanish Readiness Inventory

## Summary

This inventory assesses the Argus application for Spanish localization readiness. It identifies hardcoded English strings and language/locale handling gaps across the frontend UI, backend deterministic copy, and LLM language contracts.

**Decision:** Spanish is not release-ready for private alpha yet. This branch is
allowed to land Spanish scaffolding behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_SPANISH`, but
Spanish must remain disabled in production-like Render environments until a
Codex-owned runtime readiness gate passes. The current work stabilizes
translation keys, static UI coverage, confirmation-card state handling,
language-aware runtime normalization, and structured recovery metadata; it still
does not prove the LangGraph chat/backtest spine is fully language agnostic in
live production-like conditions.

**Runtime-state normalization update:** `codex/private-alpha-readiness` adds a
shared `resolution_provenance` normalizer for workflow snapshots, public runtime
payloads, interpreter patches, and LLM interpreter capability validation. This
addresses the known dict-shaped provenance crash class, but Spanish must remain
disabled in production-like environments until the broader Spanish runtime QA
matrix and live canary pass.

**Interpreter schema update:** `codex/private-alpha-readiness` now asks the LLM
to accept any user language while returning canonical Argus machine values, plus
`language`, `date_range_raw_text`, `date_range_intent`, and `evidence_spans`
metadata. Runtime date repair resolves canonical temporal intent first and only
passes bounded date evidence through `argus.nlp.natural_time`; it does not parse
localized whole-turn prose as a shortcut around the interpreter. This removes
the hardcoded multilingual token-table growth pattern from the normal runtime
spine. Relative endpoint edits use canonical offset math such as
`anchor=today` plus `day_offset=-1` rather than localized words such as
"ayer", "yesterday", or future per-language aliases. The slice still requires
Spanish transcript QA and live canary evidence before enabling Spanish in
production-like environments.

**Domain slot normalization update:** LLM-returned strategy and DCA cadence
values are expected to be canonical engine values such as `buy_and_hold` and
`weekly`, while localized source wording stays in evidence spans and user-facing
prose. The strategy capability registry is no longer treated as a
natural-language alias phrasebook in English, Spanish, or future languages;
unknown localized cadence text is preserved as `raw_cadence` metadata and
cleared from the executable cadence field so deterministic guardrails can ask a
follow-up instead of leaking localized prose into the engine contract. The
secondary field-fidelity audit path uses the same canonical cadence validator,
so it cannot reintroduce localized cadence prose after the main interpreter
pass.

**Recovery contract update:** recoverable chat failures now use typed recovery
codes, normalized recovery language, and structured `retry_last_turn` metadata
instead of durable English prose as the behavior contract. The user-facing
fallback copy is centralized and localized for English and Spanish, and the
frontend hydrates retry controls from metadata instead of matching message text.
This is locally verified in the readiness worktree, but Spanish must remain
disabled in production-like environments until the full Spanish runtime matrix
and live canary pass.

The findings are grouped by category:
*   **Static frontend UI copy**: ~100+ strings wrapped in `t()` with hardcoded English fallbacks.
*   **Backend deterministic user-facing copy**: ~20+ strings in API exceptions and artifact labels.
*   **LLM prompt / instruction language contracts**: ~15+ strings in system prompts and context packets.
*   **Artifact/result/status labels**: ~10+ strings defining statuses and outcomes.
*   **Test fixtures/snapshots**: ~10+ strings in validation tests.
*   **Internal logs/debug-only strings**: ~50+ log messages using English.

## Highest Priority Findings

| Area | File(s) | Finding | Risk | Owner | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend Cards** | `web/components/chat/StrategyConfirmationCard.tsx`, `web/components/chat/confirmation-display.ts`, `src/argus/api/chat/confirmation.py` | Confirmation cards now emit/use stable `status`, `rows[].key`, and i18n label keys instead of using translated labels for behavior. | Resolved | Codex-owned | Keep the `spanish-ui-smoke` guard that rejects `row.label.toLowerCase()` and English status sets in card state logic. |
| **Artifact Status** | `web/components/chat/artifact-history.ts`, `web/lib/chat-backtest-jobs.ts` | Confirmation lifecycle updates now store stable status codes while preserving legacy English fallback labels for old persisted cards. | Resolved | Codex-owned | Continue using `confirmation-display.ts` helpers for new confirmation status behavior. |
| **Onboarding** | `web/components/onboarding/OnboardingGate.tsx` | Hardcoded titles: `"Choose your language"`, `"Learn investing basics"` | Medium | Jules-safe | Ensure `t()` handles localization via JSON mapping, standardizing keys. |
| **Backend API Errors** | `src/argus/api/routers/conversations.py` | Hardcoded HTTP exception details: `"Conversation not found."`, `"Strategy not found."` | Medium | Product decision | Implement error code system (e.g., `error_code="CONVERSATION_NOT_FOUND"`) that frontend maps to `t()`. |
| **Backend Results** | `src/argus/domain/benchmark_comparison.py` | User phrases generated in backend: `"Beat by {magnitude}"`, `"In line with benchmark"` | High | Product decision | Return structured data (e.g., `{ type: "beat_benchmark", value: magnitude }`) and localize in frontend. |
| **LLM Prompts** | `src/argus/agent_runtime/stages/interpret.py` | System prompts: `"Supported-strategy facts:"`, `"Available short-lived context packet:"` | High | Codex-owned | Do not change. Treat as Codex-owned runtime contracts.|
| **Runtime State Hydration** | `src/argus/agent_runtime/state/models.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/runtime.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/graph/workflow.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/stages/interpret.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/stages/interpret_types.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/llm_interpreter.py` | Dict-shaped `resolution_provenance` entries are normalized/deduped before durable snapshot carry-forward, public payload serialization, interpreter patches, and LLM interpreter capability validation. | Partially resolved | Codex-owned | Keep the regression tests; still run the full Spanish continuation QA matrix before enabling Spanish in Render. |
| **LLM Interpreter Metadata** | `src/argus/agent_runtime/llm_interpreter.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/llm_interpreter_types.py`, `src/argus/nlp/natural_time.py` | Structured interpretation now carries `language`, `date_range_raw_text`, `date_range_intent`, and `evidence_spans`; canonical temporal intent is resolved deterministically, and bounded date evidence is resolved through the natural-time wrapper instead of month/date language tables inside runtime contracts. | Partially resolved | Codex-owned | Keep the canonical-intent, bounded-span, and contract-boundary tests; add Spanish transcript/live QA before enabling Spanish. |
| **Recovery Copy** | `src/argus/agent_runtime/recovery_messages.py`, `src/argus/api/routers/agent.py`, `web/lib/argus-api.ts`, `web/components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` | Recoverable chat failures now persist typed recovery metadata, localized fallback copy, and structured retry metadata instead of making English prose the durable behavior contract. | Locally resolved | Codex-owned | Keep the recovery contract tests green and include Spanish recovery in the final live canary before enabling Spanish in Render. |

| `src/argus/agent_runtime/llm_interpreter.py`, `src/argus/agent_runtime/llm_interpreter_types.py` | LLM interpreter schema and prompt now require canonical internal values, detected language, bounded date raw text, canonical `date_range_intent`, and evidence spans; conversion stores that metadata in `StrategySummary.extra_parameters`. | Interpreter contract | Partially resolved | Codex-owned | Do not make raw text executable by itself; use canonical intent or bounded evidence, keep deterministic validation, and add Spanish runtime transcript coverage. |

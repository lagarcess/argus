# Cuadrao WhatsApp receipt intake: activation packet

**Status:** built locally on `claude/business-pilot-whatsapp`, default-off, not
pushed. Parent scope: `docs/specs/lanes/cuadrao-business-owner-pilot.md`
("WhatsApp receipt intake"). The destination owner is pending the Business
boundary decision (`cuadrao-business-boundary-proposal.md`, not approved).

## What it does

A linked owner sends a receipt photo (JPEG, PNG) or PDF to the Cuadrao WhatsApp
number. Cuadrao saves it as a document draft with `consent: false` and replies
with a signed-in review link, `/biz?receipt=<id>`. Correction, "Prepare with
AI" and approval happen only on the web. WhatsApp never queues AI preparation.

Linking needs proof of possession. The signed-in owner creates a one-time code
on the web, then sends `CUADRAO <code>` from their own WhatsApp. A typed phone
number proves nothing. Unknown senders get no capture and a "connect from the
web app" reply. Contract: `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`, "WhatsApp receipt intake".

## Proof levels

| Level | What it proves | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fixture proof (done) | Signature gate, parsing, linking, replay, isolation, media limits, no AI queueing, privacy-safe logs | Synthetic Meta payloads in `tests/fixtures/whatsapp/`, a scripted Graph API and a recording reply transport. No network. Same cases on real Postgres. |
| Real delivery proof (not done) | Meta reaches the callback, the signature and media download work against Meta, and a reply arrives on a phone. Fixture proof cannot show this. | The founder steps below with one synthetic receipt and an approved test sender. |

## Founder setup in Meta (one time)

1. In the Meta App Dashboard, create an app with the WhatsApp use case. Meta
   creates a test WhatsApp Business account and a test business number.
2. In WhatsApp > API Setup, note the **Phone number ID** and the test number.
   Generate an access token. Under the "To" field, choose "Manage phone number
   list" and add your personal WhatsApp as a test recipient. Confirm the code
   Meta sends to that phone.
3. In App settings > Basic, copy the **App secret**.
4. Choose a verify token: any long random string you keep private.
5. In WhatsApp > Configuration > Webhook, set the callback URL to
   `https://<tunnel host>/api/v1/webhooks/whatsapp` and the verify token from
   step 4, then Verify and save. Subscribe to the webhook field `messages` only.

Proof: step 5 shows "Verified" only if our GET handler answered the challenge.

## Environment (API process only, never the web app)

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_INTAKE_ENABLED` | `true` |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN` | step 4 |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_APP_SECRET` | step 3 |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN` | step 2 token |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` | step 2 Phone number ID |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_DISPLAY_PHONE_NUMBER` | the test number, for the `wa.me` link |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_SENDER_KEY` | a new random secret; rotating it unlinks every sender |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_GRAPH_API_VERSION` | optional, default `v23.0` |
| `ARGUS_WHATSAPP_OUTBOUND_ENABLED` | `false` for the first run, then `true` for the reply check |
| `ARGUS_APP_ORIGIN` | the web origin used in the review link |

The surface also needs `ARGUS_FINANCIAL_ACCOUNTS_ENABLED`,
`ARGUS_INGESTION_ENABLED` and `ARGUS_DOCUMENT_EXTRACTION_ENABLED`. Apply
`20261008130000_whatsapp_intake.sql` to the local stack first. Nothing is added
to `render.yaml`; hosted activation is a separate decision.

## Temporary tunnel (bounded)

Meta needs a public HTTPS callback. Run the API locally on port 8000, then:

```sh
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```

Use the printed `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` host in step 5. The tunnel
exposes the whole local API, so keep it up only for the test session, then stop
it with Ctrl-C and delete the callback URL in the Meta dashboard. A new run gets
a new host and needs step 5 again.

## Real delivery test

1. With outbound off, sign in on the web and call
   `POST /api/v1/whatsapp/link-codes`. Open `wa_me_url` on your phone and send
   the prefilled `CUADRAO <code>`. Proof: `GET /api/v1/whatsapp/link` shows
   `linked: true` and your last four digits.
2. Send one synthetic receipt photo. Proof: the API logs `WhatsApp message
   settled` with `status=captured`, and `GET /api/v1/financial-documents`
   lists a `saved` draft with `consent: false`. No preparation runs.
3. Send the same photo again. Proof: no second draft.
4. Turn outbound on and restart. Send a second synthetic receipt. Proof: the
   phone receives the acknowledgement with the review link, and the link opens
   the draft only when signed in as you.
5. `DELETE /api/v1/whatsapp/link`, then send a photo. Proof: no capture and a
   "connect from the web app" reply.
6. Stop the tunnel. Remove the callback URL. Logs never hold a phone number,
   message text, media id or provider message id, only a digest prefix.

## Cost and messaging limits

- Messages a user sends to a business are not charged, and non-template
  replies inside the 24-hour customer service window are free
  ([Meta pricing](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/pricing)).
  Every reply here answers the person's own message inside that window.
- Meta generates the test business number automatically
  ([Meta business phone numbers](https://developers.facebook.com/documentation/business-messaging/whatsapp/business-phone-numbers/phone-numbers)).
  Its recipient limit and free use were not confirmed from a primary source in
  this lane; confirm both in the API Setup panel before the test.
- Outside the 24-hour window a message needs an approved template and may be
  charged. Intake never starts a conversation, so it sends none.
- Media URLs from Meta expire after 5 minutes. A 404 or 410 records the
  delivery as `failed` and asks the person to resend. A resend captures
  normally, and a redelivery of the same message retries the failed record.

## Needs the Business boundary decision

- `resolve_intake_destination` in `src/argus/api/whatsapp.py` returns the
  signed-in person. Under option A it returns the business principal through an
  active owner membership, and captures land under `business_id`.
- The reply language reads `profiles.language` of the destination owner. A
  principal has no profile, so option A should read the linking person's
  language instead.
- Reply copy is a Spanish-first draft and needs founder approval.

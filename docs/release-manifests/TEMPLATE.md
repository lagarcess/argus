# Private Alpha Release Manifest Template

Use one manifest per validated candidate checkpoint or promoted candidate.
Start it before promotion, record the production migration gate before any
deploy-capable action, and finish it after the release gate passes and before
sending tester links. A validated private-alpha checkpoint records technical
evidence only; it does not itself authorize a `main` merge, production
deployment, automatic production deployment, tester invitation, or tester
exposure. Do not include raw conversation, user, run, or job ids; use the
privacy-safe labels from canary evidence.

## Candidate

- Candidate SHA:
- Candidate branch:
- Validation status:
- Validation surface:
- Promotion target: `main`
- Release captain:
- Approver:
- Rollback target:
- Decision record:

## Production Migration Gate

- Gate command: `scripts/ops/production_migration_gate.py`
- Gate report durable attachment or committed path:
- Gate checked at:
- Gate candidate SHA:
- Gated candidate parents and intended landing method:
- Landed `origin/main` SHA:
- Gate-to-landed-SHA identity: exact / invalidated and rerun
- Landed-ref verification: `--verify-landed-ref origin/main`, status and SHA
- Sanitized production project and database host:
- Candidate migrations, with version, name, and SHA-256:
- Applied production migrations, with version and name:
- Latest applied production migration:
- Missing migrations:
- Unexpected applied migrations:
- Migration name drift:
- Safety classifications and live requirements for every missing migration:
- Classification basis and human live-schema review:
- Gate result: `status=pass` required before service deploy
- Gate human-approval state:
- Gate apply result: `not_performed_by_gate`
- Gate ledger readback:
- Human apply performed: no / yes, by:
- If applied, repository order and ledger before/after:
- If applied, affected-object readback:
- Confirm the gate never applies migrations:

## Privacy Notes

- No raw conversation, user, run, or job ids.
- Canary labels are stable hashes for audit correlation only.
- The release profile contains no credentials, account ids, deploy ids, or
  candidate SHA; record its hash with the candidate evidence instead.
- Failed-capture artifacts are sanitized replay inputs, not raw transcripts.
- Service-role credentials, cookies, prompts, and route receipt payloads are not
  copied into this manifest.
- Guest evidence contains no Auth UUID, raw conversation/artifact/job/run ids,
  email, tokens, cookies, headers, screenshots of credentials, or transcript
  dumps. Store only privacy-safe hashes and aggregate/count facts.

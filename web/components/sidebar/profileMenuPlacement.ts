 * Where the profile menu puts itself, and why it depends on what opened it.
 *
 * From the rail it is a detached popover: portaled to the body, pinned near the
 * bottom left, with submenus flying out to the right into open desktop space.
 * None of that survives a drawer. Portaled out, it landed under the drawer's
 * own layer and opened invisibly; flown out to the right, its submenus cleared
 * the right edge of a 390px screen by 155px.
 *
 * So the drawer keeps the menu inside the panel's stacking context and stacks
 * submenus upward at the parent's width instead.

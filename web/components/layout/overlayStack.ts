/**
 * One registry for every open overlay, and one place that routes input to them.
 *
 * The old shape gave every overlay its own document-level listener and asked it
 * to work out whether it should stay quiet. That is the wrong default: a
 * listener that exists will run, so correctness depended on each surface
 * remembering to check the stack, and every combination we had not thought of
 * was a bug. It produced the same failure five times, in five different
 * surfaces, each fix teaching one more component to stand down.
 *
 * So the layers are the state and the routing is central. A surface says it is
 * open and what it wants to do; it never listens. Escape, Tab containment, and
 * outside-dismiss go to the topmost layer and stop there. A new overlay cannot
 * reintroduce this class of bug by forgetting a guard, because there is no
 * guard for it to forget.
 *
 * This is the shape Radix and Headless UI settled on for the same problem.

/**
 * The only action on the page, kept in reach, with the caveat attached to it.
 *
 * A viewer arrives from someone else's message and the action used to sit about
 * 1.4 screens down, so most readers never reached it. Fixed to the bottom it is in
 * the thumb zone from the first paint.
 *
 * The framing travels with the button and is not optional. A call to action that is
 * permanently on screen is mildly promotional on a page a stranger did not ask for,
 * and pairing it with what the page actually is, a what if on prices that already
 * happened, is what makes that acceptable. It also inverts the old arrangement,
 * where the caveat was the thing scrolled past and the button was the thing found.
 *
 * Position is CSS only. There is no scroll listener and no reveal, so the bar cannot
 * behave differently before hydration than after it. The click still reports the
 * funnel stage, which is the contract the owner-side counters read.

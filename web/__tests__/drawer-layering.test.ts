/**
 * Anything that can be open while the drawer is has to outrank the drawer.
 *
 * The drawer shipped at z-100 while every surface it hosts sits at 70 to 80,
 * so tapping Settings opened the profile menu underneath the panel that
 * launched it. Nothing looked broken: the menu mounted, its buttons were in the
 * DOM with real bounding boxes, and hit-testing found the drawer on top. Only a
 * human on a phone could see that the tap did nothing.
 *
 * The first version of this test walked only what the drawer imports, and
 * missed Recents Quick Peek because it is a sibling rendered through
 * `KeyboardShortcutSurfaces`. Being a sibling is not protection: its shortcut
 * still fired with the drawer open, so it opened at z-65 behind a z-68 drawer,
 * invisible but focusable. The walk starts from the drawer's host now, which
 * covers anything the same screen can render.
 *
 * Reviews do not catch this, because the two numbers live in different files
 * and neither is wrong on its own.

/**
 * Visual baselines for the surfaces no queued lane is rewriting.
 *
 * A visual suite is only worth having if red means "something changed".
 * Everything here exists to remove a reason for a false red:
 *
 *  - fixture data, so no model output or live market data reaches a capture;
 *  - a fixed timezone and locale, because the allowance panel renders dates and
 *    a machine in another zone would otherwise fail every run;
 *  - `deviceScaleFactor: 1` and `scale: "css"`, so a retina laptop and a CI
 *    container rasterise at the same size;
 *  - animations disabled and the caret hidden, so a capture taken half a second
 *    later is the same bytes;
 *  - a per-pixel `threshold` plus a small `maxDiffPixelRatio`, which absorbs
 *    font antialiasing without absorbing a moved element.
 *
 * Run and refresh with:
 *
 *   bun run test:e2e:breakpoints
 *   bun run test:e2e:breakpoints:update
 *
 * Use those scripts rather than `bunx playwright`. `bunx` resolves the latest
 * published playwright, not the version pinned in package.json, so it would
 * quietly re-render every baseline the day a new minor ships. `bun run` uses
 * node_modules/.bin, which is the pinned one.
 *
 * Baselines are platform-suffixed, so a run on one OS never argues with another
 * OS's committed set. The committed set is darwin. CI is ubuntu and does not
 * run this spec; before adding it, generate the linux set from the repo root in
 * the image matching the pinned version:
 *
 *   docker run --rm --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v "$PWD":/w \
 *     -w /w/web -e PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3195 \
 *     mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.59.1-noble \
 *     node ./node_modules/@playwright/test/cli.js \
 *     -c e2e/breakpoint-baselines.playwright.config.ts --update-snapshots
 *
 * That path is not proven end to end: legal and auth capture cleanly, but the
 * settings walk needs a /chat boot and timed out against a host-side dev server.
 * Running the dev server inside the container instead is the likely fix, and is
 * work for whoever wires this into CI.

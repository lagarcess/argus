/**
 * Observation backstop for the storage chokepoint.
 *
 * The chokepoint and the ESLint ban make an undisclosed key hard to write.
 * This watches what a real browser actually kept during a real journey, so it
 * does not depend on predicting syntax: an aliased handle, a wrapper, a
 * dynamic key, or a dependency writing its own key are all recorded the same
 * way, because Storage.prototype is patched before any page script runs.
 *
 * The property asserted is what the copy actually claims: what your browser
 * *holds*. A library write-test that sets a key and immediately removes it
 * leaves nothing on the device, so it is not disclosable state. Those are
 * proven transient from the removal log rather than assumed from absence, and
 * anything a writer keeps still shows up in what remains.
 *
 * Bounded by the journey below. That bound is why the chokepoint exists too.

 * error rather than a silent write. The privacy copy is derived from this
 * registry instead of being inferred by searching for call sites, because a
 * search only finds the syntactic forms someone thought to look for.
 *
 * An ESLint rule bans localStorage, sessionStorage, and document.cookie
 * everywhere but this file, so writing an undisclosed key means visibly
 * disabling that rule in review rather than aliasing a handle.

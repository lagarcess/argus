# Android chart validation

Standalone synthetic Compose application (`ai.argus.chartprototype`). It owns no
production screen, network permission, authentication, or financial computation.
The only data source is `../fixtures/series.json`, packaged through Gradle's asset
source directory. `Fixture.kt` partitions each actual/projected series into
contiguous segments so nulls cannot become connecting lines. X coordinates are
civil epoch days; UTC dates never shift with device timezone. Vico renders straight
paths. Projected lines are dashed; singleton segments have visible points.

A transparent Compose gesture surface maps horizontal drags to the nearest fixture
date (ties earlier), including missing rows. The same selection state powers the
readout and Previous/Next/Reset buttons. Vertical gestures belong to the page.
Release retains selection; cancellation restores its pre-drag value. Scenario
changes clear it; language/theme changes retain it. This custom adapter is needed
because selecting only Vico's non-null rendered targets would skip missing dates.
No curves, interpolation or inferred finance facts are introduced.

## Pin and compatibility

The existing #730 Android setup was inspected without merging or editing it:
AGP 9.1.1, Gradle 9.3.1, Kotlin/Compose plugin 2.2.10, Compose BOM 2025.08.01,
compile/target API 36, minSdk 26. Vico Android Compose **2.5.1** is pinned; it is the
stable Android series, not the 3.x Compose Multiplatform prerelease direction.

Official sources inspected September 28, 2026:

- [Vico 2.5.1 release](https://github.com/patrykandpatrick/vico/releases/tag/v2.5.1)
- [Vico Compose layer guide](https://www.patrykandpatrick.com/vico/guide/stable/android/compose/cartesian-charts/cartesian-layer)
- [Vico 2.5.1 published Compose sources](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/patrykandpatrick/vico/compose/2.5.1/compose-2.5.1-sources.jar)
- [Vico 2.5.1 published core sources](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/patrykandpatrick/vico/core/2.5.1/core-2.5.1-sources.jar)
- [AGP 9.1.1 official compatibility](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/agp-9-1-0-release-notes)

Resolved dependency caveat: Vico 2.5.1 raises Compose UI/runtime/foundation to
1.11.1, Material3 to 1.4.0, core-ktx to 1.18.0 and Kotlin stdlib to 2.3.21 above
#730's BOM 2025.08.01 baseline. A regular BOM is not an enforced version lock.
This standalone project compiles and its emulator tests pass, but adopting that
graph in the native shell needs its owner's coordination. Do not copy this
library pin into the shared build and assume unchanged dependency versions.

The source artifacts, rather than newer 3.x API pages, define the exact APIs used.
The app uses Android Studio's installed JBR 25 with Java source/target 17. Build
and emulator results are recorded in the evidence directory. Declaring minSdk 26
is not evidence of API 26 runtime behavior. No physical phone is certified here.

## Reproduce

From this directory, with Android SDK API 36/system image installed:

```sh
export JAVA_HOME='/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home'
export ANDROID_HOME="$HOME/Library/Android/sdk"
export GRADLE_USER_HOME=/tmp/argus-chart-gradle
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest
```

Create a dedicated instance; never operate another lane's device:

```sh
export ANDROID_AVD_HOME=/tmp/argus-chart-avd
mkdir -p "$ANDROID_AVD_HOME"
printf 'no\n' | "$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/19.0/bin/avdmanager" create avd \
  -n Argus_Chart_Validation_2825 -k 'system-images;android-36;google_apis;arm64-v8a' \
  -d pixel_4 -p "$ANDROID_AVD_HOME/Argus_Chart_Validation_2825.avd"
"$ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator" -avd Argus_Chart_Validation_2825 -port 5584 \
  -no-snapshot -no-window -no-audio -gpu swiftshader -no-boot-anim
```

In another terminal:

```sh
export ANDROID_SERIAL=emulator-5584
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleDebugAndroidTest :app:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" install -r app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" shell am instrument -w \
  ai.argus.chartprototype.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" pull /sdcard/Android/data/ai.argus.chartprototype/files/ ./device-evidence
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" shell dumpsys gfxinfo ai.argus.chartprototype
adb -s "$ANDROID_SERIAL" emu kill
```

The explicit adb runner keeps the app installed until evidence is pulled; Gradle's connected-test runner automatically uninstalls it.

The instrumented suite exercises every fixture, missing-row segment preservation,
endpoint readouts, English/es-419, theme modes, horizontal release/cancel/reset,
vertical scroll, and twelve real-time shell-input long-series scrubs (300 ms each). Measurements explicitly
include test synchronization and are not finger-to-screen latency claims.

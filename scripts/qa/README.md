# Issue-248 real-auth QA harness

End-to-end account-recovery and session-control QA against real Supabase Auth.
Everything here targets the worktree-local Supabase stack (or one approved QA
branch) and is blocked from production by `assert-nonprod-target.sh`.

## One-shot run

```bash
supabase start -x vector,edge-runtime,imgproxy   # once per machine boot
supabase db reset --local                        # migrations from zero + seed
bash scripts/qa/write-local-env.sh               # untracked .env + web/.env.local
bash scripts/qa/run-local-auth-qa.sh             # guard -> backend -> identities -> journeys
```

The local stack uses the stable `project_id = "argus-qa"` (containers such as
`supabase_db_argus-qa`) and a same-site topology — app on
`http://localhost:3000`, API on `http://localhost:8000` — so the Argus
HttpOnly cookie transport is real in local QA.

The runner executes six Playwright phases from `web/e2e/qa-248/`:

1. `1-recovery.spec.ts` — enumeration safety, Mailpit delivery, single PKCE
   exchange, reset, reuse/malformed/expired links, correct-current-password
   change. The wrong-current-password rejection is enforced by the hosted
   `security_update_password_require_current_password` policy, which the
   local CLI cannot enable, so that journey lives in the hosted live matrix.
2. `2-sessions.spec.ts` — two-context revoke-others/revoke-all, ordinary
   logout scope, revoked-bearer rejection, partial cookie-cleanup honesty.
3. `3-es-mobile.spec.ts` — Spanish + mobile surfaces, cross-user isolation.
4. `5-password-change-session.spec.ts` — session-integrity pins for the
   password-change path (expected-fail tripwire until provider-native
   `current_password` enforcement exists; see the spec header).
5. `6-argus-cookie-path.spec.ts` — the Argus HttpOnly cookie transport:
   cookie-only auth, stale-cookie rejection after revocation, cookie
   clearing on successful logout.
6. `4-verification-outage.spec.ts` — retryable 503 while the verification
   database is down and the auth provider stays healthy (runner-orchestrated).

Evidence (screenshots, HTML report, backend log, current-password state) lands
in `temp/qa-evidence-248/`.

## Product limits the harness must respect

- Argus login limiter: 8 attempts per email and per IP per 10 minutes. The
  runner restarts the backend between spec files; each file stays within one
  identity's budget.
- Argus recovery limiter: 5 requests per email and per client address per 10
  minutes. Specs use run-unique `x-forwarded-for` addresses; sends to the
  recovery identity stay at 3 per run, so leave ~10 minutes between full runs
  against a still-running server (fresh servers reset the in-memory buckets).
- GoTrue `max_frequency` (1s between sends per user): specs call
  `respectSendWindow()` before repeat sends.
- `supabase/config.toml` pins `otp_expiry = 60` so the expired-link journey
  completes in-band. Production keeps its own expiry.

## Identities

`setup-local-identities.sh` creates two disposable users through the real
Argus signup path (allowlist rows come from `supabase/seed.sql`), verifies
login, and writes runtime credentials to untracked `.qa-identities.env`.
It talks only to the stack's HTTP surface (auth admin + PostgREST), so it
needs no Docker access; only the `auth.sessions` row-count assertions in
spec 5 shell into the local db container and skip when Docker is absent.
`--teardown` removes users, profiles, and the credential file. Passwords are
generated per setup run and never committed; recovery journeys persist the
current password in `temp/qa-evidence-248/qa-state.json`.

## Hosted QA branch mode

Export `ARGUS_QA_APPROVED_SUPABASE_REF=<branch project ref>` and point the
generated env files at that branch before running; the guard then admits
exactly that ref and still hard-fails on any production reference.
Mailpit-dependent recovery specs skip in hosted mode — hosted recovery
delivery stays gated on sandbox SMTP.

## Backend tests

The focused backend matrix must run hermetically, per `AGENTS.md`:

```bash
OPENROUTER_API_KEY= ALPACA_API_KEY= ALPACA_SECRET_KEY= \
ARGUS_MARKET_DATA_PROVIDER_MODE=synthetic_unit_fixture \
poetry run pytest tests/test_auth_sessions.py tests/test_alpha_api_supabase.py \
  tests/test_alpha_artifacts.py tests/test_environment_scripts.py -q --no-cov
```

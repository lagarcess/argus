"""Apply an explicit list of migration versions to a named database.

The Supabase CLI cannot do this job against production's ledger: it stops on
local files older than the remote head and on remote rows with no local file,
and ``--include-all`` would re-run history whose effects already exist. This
tool applies only the versions it is given, in order, and records each ledger
row exactly as ``production_migration_gate.py`` reads it (the file's own
version and name, statements split by the gate's splitter).

A hosted Supabase host is refused unless a committed hosted approval record names
it. The record carries the project ref, the exact host names and database, the
candidate commit, a digest of the exact version list, an expiry and the founder's
approval reference. The tool checks every one of them, requires the record to be
committed after the candidate and unmodified, connects with TLS required, and only
executes when ``--hosted-confirm`` repeats the record's id. With no record the
behaviour is the one for local databases. A name check cannot tell that an IP
literal is a hosted database, so an allow-listed IP literal is not recognised as
hosted; never allow-list one.

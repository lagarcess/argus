-- What the user asked Argus to call them, which is not who their account says
-- they are. `display_name` is an identity field people fill with a legal name,
-- so reusing it would put "What is next, Lucas Garces?" on the empty chat.

-- Optional by design: being addressed by name is not universally welcome, and a
-- dedicated field makes it a choice the user made rather than a side effect of
-- having an account. Null means the greeting uses no name.

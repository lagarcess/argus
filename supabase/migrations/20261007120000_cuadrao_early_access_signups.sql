-- Cuadrao marketing site: Personal early-access signups (#882).
-- Spec: docs/specs/cuadrao-marketing-forms-contract.md.
--
-- One row per normalized address, keyed by its SHA-256 digest. Visitors have no
-- Argus account, so nothing here references auth.users and the account deletion
-- census is unaffected.
--
-- Removing a signup erases the address but keeps the digest and a removed_at
-- timestamp. That row is the suppression record: the page's insert conflicts
-- with it and is ignored, so a removed address is never registered or notified
-- again, and the visitor cannot tell a new address from a removed one.
--
-- Only the marketing service writes this table, through service_role. RLS is on
-- with no policy, and anon and authenticated hold no privilege, so the project's
-- public API keys cannot read or write it.

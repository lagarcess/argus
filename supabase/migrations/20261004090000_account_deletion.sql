-- Lane 6: in-app account deletion.
-- Spec: docs/specs/lanes/mvee-five-lane-handoff.md#lane-6-account-deletion
-- Census: docs/specs/lanes/account-deletion-fk-census.md
-- Design: Marcus's Lane 6 design note on #791, with Lucas's Oct 2 overrides.
--
-- What this adds:
--   1. The composite owner keys the deletion re-keys become DEFERRABLE
--      INITIALLY IMMEDIATE. Today's writers see no change: only the deletion
--      definers defer them, and they set every constraint immediate before
--      they return. ON DELETE actions are unchanged, and Postgres keeps
--      RESTRICT immediate on a deferrable key.
--   2. household_plan_participants.joined_at, the seniority the plan handover
--      uses (#787). A re-grant resets it.
--   3. household_members.former_member_number for the "Exmiembro" placeholder.
--   4. argus_private.account_placeholders, the run record, its in-flight
--      placeholder map and its pending revocations.
--   5. The auth.users triggers skip placeholders, and the placeholder domain
--      is refused to everyone else.
--   6. The Household-owned invite function, the locked-column guard and the
--      deletion definers.
--
-- 20261003140000 says the kept sender reference preserves per-user invite
-- counts. Since Lane 6 that is no longer true for a deleted sender:
-- forget_invite_party (6a) rotates sender_ref to a distinct fresh value per
-- row (inviter_origin_id chain unchanged) and drops the mapping row, so
-- nothing groups their invites and their per-user count intentionally ends.
-- The note lives here because landed migrations are immutable.
--
-- Placeholders (Yelena, HoE, Oct 2, 11:06 PM CT rule, matching #796): one per
-- (household or standalone shared group, departed person); every plan and
-- membership-keyed row of the person in one household goes to that
-- household's placeholder. Each is a nameless auth.users row created through
-- the Supabase Admin API as `exmiembro+<random uuid>@cuadrao.invalid`, email
-- confirmed, app_metadata {"placeholder": true}, user metadata {}, no phone,
-- no password, banned by ban_duration (GoTrue sets banned_until). Decision
-- 17's "no user id" means no id tied to the person: the FKs need a real
-- auth.users row. Never DML on auth.users here.
--
-- Method: move in place under the DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE keys, plus
-- account copies (one per scope), not copy, re-point, delete. Deferral does
-- not relax three row rules, so each statement must satisfy them:
--   * shared claim must retain its canonical binding (shared_claim_binding):
--     financial_plan_links.user_id is the binding owner, so a binding moves
--     before its claims;
--   * shared allocation must retain true owner and consent
--     (shared_allocation_binding on financial_goal_allocations);
--   * financial_record_revisions.reversal_of_owner_id is generated and
--     changes only through details, which the writer rewrites.

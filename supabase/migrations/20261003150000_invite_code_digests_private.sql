-- Invite code hardening (#789).
-- Spec: docs/API_CONTRACT.md "Invite code security"; issue #789.
--
-- 1. Code digests move off client-readable tables. They lived in
--    public.household_invitations.code_hash and public.beta_invitations.code_hash,
--    beside owner-scoped SELECT policies. No client role has SELECT on either
--    table today, but one later grant would have exposed them. They now live in
--    argus_private, which anon and authenticated cannot even reach, with RLS on
--    and no policy for any role, and no privilege for anon, authenticated or
--    service_role. Only the backend database owner reads and writes it.
-- 2. Digests are HMAC-SHA-256 under a server secret (ARGUS_INVITE_CODE_SECRET)
--    and say which key made them: v2.<key id>.<hex>. The check below refuses
--    anything else, so an unkeyed digest can never be written again.
-- 3. The old v1 digests were unkeyed SHA-256 of 8-character codes. A digest
--    cannot be turned back into its code, so they cannot be re-hashed; they
--    are dropped. Existing invitations keep every other column and still open
--    by their link token; only their old typed code stops working. All such
--    rows are test data (no code flag has been on in any hosted environment).

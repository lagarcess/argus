"""The closed product analytics registry: Iris's wave 1 events, and nothing else.

Each event is one Pydantic model whose fields are the event's exact properties.
Fields are typed only as ``Literal[...]``, ``bool``, a bounded ``int``, a
string checked against a closed vocabulary another owner lists (the calculation
catalog), or the one pattern-constrained ``cohort`` string, so an amount, a
name, an email, or any other free text cannot be represented, let alone sent
(SPEC 0, 0.5, A4).

PostHog receives each event under its own name. The sink in ``envelope.py``
sends an envelope only when ``registered_payload()`` below re-validates it as
one of these models, so this module is the only way an event reaches PostHog.

"""The no-search answer that owns its math.

When the user's own figures are enough, or a lookup failed, the answer comes
from one voicing call that returns prose and its typed calculations, one per
option. Their inputs may be the user's words, Argus market data for a current
price, or assumptions the answer states; a page only when it was retrieved for
this conversation. The answer step computes each card and fills the prose's
figures from them. Figures only the user knows become one plain question.

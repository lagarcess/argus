"""Focused asset-discovery read: the mode-A backstop for an omitted payload.

The primary interpreter sometimes answers a discovery request as a plain
educational turn and leaves the asset_discovery payload empty (#344). This
second read asks the one narrow question the primary collapsed away: does
this turn ask Argus to find assets? It runs only on payloadless
knowledge-shaped turns with no other surface claim, and every recovery is
recorded with a reason code (AGENTS.md: redundancy over an LLM read must be
observable).

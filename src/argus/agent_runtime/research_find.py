"""The rail's find operation: asset discovery as an operation, not a sibling.

Spec section 11b. The router dispatches discovery-shaped questions here; the
composer pipeline in ``agent_runtime.discovery`` stays the implementation
engine for extraction, resolver validation, and voicing, while this module
supplies what made discovery a parallel system: the shared research cache in
front of the provider, the research meter underneath, and the typed research
sidecar so one settlement path and one transcript contract cover every
question shape. The discovery sidecar and its typed action rows are
unchanged; the user-visible experience is the same or better.

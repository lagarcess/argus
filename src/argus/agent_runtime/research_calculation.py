"""A research answer's calculation, and the answer when a lookup fails.

The research provider returns prose and its calculations; they compute here
through the answer step, with the pages this answer retrieved as the only
pages an input may cite. An unusable calculation leaves the research prose
standing. When the lookup fails,
the no-search step answers from Argus market data and stated assumptions and
says what it could not look up: a failed lookup never becomes the answer.

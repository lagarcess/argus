"""The answer step owns the math.

An answering model, the research provider or the no-search voicing model,
returns its prose and its ``AnswerCalculation`` list, one per option the reader
weighs. Each input is held to its source: a page retrieved for this answer,
Argus's own market data for a current price, the user's words, or an assumption
the answer states. Each declaration computes its own card. The prose states
figures only as references filled from those cards, ``{{name}}`` or, with more
than one calculation, ``{{calculation.name}}``; a reference that does not
resolve, or a money or percent figure written outside a reference, hands the
answer to Argus's own lead, and an assumed input the prose never names is listed
under the answer. Every guard that changes what the
model wrote records a reason code.

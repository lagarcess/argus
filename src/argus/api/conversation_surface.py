"""Which side of a person's chats a request and a conversation belong to.

The client names a surface, never a space. ``surface_scope`` turns the surface
into an ``OwnerScope`` with ``resolve_business_scope``. Business answers 404
unless the pilot is on and the person has started their space, like the other
Business routes. A stored conversation's side comes from its ``owner_space_id``
through ``conversation_scope``. Personal artifacts (decisions, evidence,
receipts, memory) never attach to a Business conversation:
``require_personal_conversation`` answers 404 for one.

Business chat has its own flag inside the pilot. While it is off no Business
conversation is created and nothing writes a turn into one
(``refuse_closed_chat``, ``require_open_business_chat``); reading and deleting
existing ones still works.

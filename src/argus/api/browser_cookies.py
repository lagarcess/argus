"""The single door through which Argus writes cookies to a browser.

Every cookie name is declared in ``COOKIE_REGISTRY`` with the privacy-policy
category that discloses it, and :func:`set_browser_cookie` refuses a name that
is not there. The privacy copy is derived from this registry rather than
inferred by searching for call sites, because a search can only find the
syntactic forms someone thought to look for.

Writing an undisclosed cookie therefore requires bypassing this module on
purpose, which shows up in review, rather than following from ordinary code.

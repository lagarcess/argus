"""In-app account deletion (Lane 6).

``POST /api/v1/account/delete`` runs the whole deletion command for the signed-in
person. It is off unless ``ARGUS_ACCOUNT_DELETION_ENABLED`` is on, and while off
it answers 404 before any authentication. The user id comes only from the
verified session, never from the request body. A guest session is deleted
the same way. A person whose run is in flight (locked out of every other
route) may call it again to resume their own run (``account_deletion_auth``).

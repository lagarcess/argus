"""The account deletion command (Lane 6).

Order, matching ``docs/specs/lanes/account-deletion-fk-census.md``:

1. Claim the run, opening it on the first request. The run is keyed on a hash
   of the user id; the id itself is held only while the run is in flight, so a
   retry finds the same run and reuses the same placeholders. Every pass (a
   request, a retry, the sweep) first takes the run's claim and releases it at
   the end, so two passes never revoke or delete in parallel; a pass that
   finds the claim held gets ``AccountDeletionIncomplete("in_progress")``.
   From here the account is locked: the session check rejects any JWT whose
   user has a run in flight (except on the delete route itself, so the person
   can resume), and the auth user is banned through the Admin API so no
   refresh or sign-in succeeds.
2. Reserve one placeholder id per sharing scope the person's rows are pinned
   in (a household, or an activity group shared outside any plan), then
   create each placeholder through the Admin API. Ids are registered before
   the create, so the auth triggers already skip them.
3. One database transaction: steps 1.1 to 1.3 per household, archives passed
   on, sources captured for revocation and removed (2), invite ids forgotten
   (4), future responsibilities returned, each unit moved to its placeholder
   (5.1, 5.2), the person's own plans deleted (5.3), feedback stripped (6),
   then a check that nothing still holds the id.
4. Every third-party step runs before the account delete, inside the run:
   Sign in with Apple (#793), then the captured Plaid access tokens and Gmail
   (Google) refresh tokens, then PostHog person deletion (8). Revoked counts as
   done; a provider that no longer held the grant (``invalid_grant``, Google
   ``invalid_token``, Plaid's item gone; #802 for Apple) is recorded
   ``already_revoked`` and counted for the spike alert. The person's retained
   document sources (#778) are deleted from Storage by their owner prefix,
   which also takes any object a crashed capture left unreferenced. A transient failure
   leaves that step pending: the run stays ``data_deleted``, the account stays
   locked, the auth delete waits, and the operator-run resume sweep
   (``scripts/ops/resume_account_deletions.py`` inside scheduled_maintenance)
   or the person's own retry resumes it. A step pending for 7 days raises an
   operator alert; only an operator can force-complete it, with a reason kept
   in the run record (``force_complete_step``). There is no user-facing
   bypass.
   A credential that does not open is given up only when ``key_check`` shows
   it was sealed under this process's key (its stored key fingerprint equals
   the key's): then a Plaid or Gmail one is recorded ``unrecoverable`` and an
   Apple one goes through #802's ``discard_unreadable``. A different or
   missing fingerprint, or no key, keeps the credential pending with its
   ciphertext and alerts. No token is ever logged.
5. Right before the auth delete, every RESTRICT key to auth.users is read from
   the catalog; a late write that still holds the person is scrubbed once more.
   The auth user is deleted through the Admin API (7); unused placeholders are
   deleted; the run drops the user id, both hashes, the placeholder map and the
   revocation rows, keeping only counts, and ends ``done``.

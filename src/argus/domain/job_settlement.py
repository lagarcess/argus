"""The one owner of "this job's result is readable in its conversation".

A succeeded ``backtest_jobs`` row settles its conversation only once its
result can be hydrated. That rule is stated here, once, as an expression over
named facts. Both persistence layers derive from it:

- the memory store evaluates :data:`JOB_RESULT_HYDRATEABLE` over facts it
  gathers (``argus.api.conversation_activity``);
- the SQL function ``argus_private.backtest_job_result_hydrateable`` is
  rendered from the same expression by :func:`render_sql_function`, and the
  migration test asserts the checked-in function is exactly that rendering.

Each layer still owns how it observes a fact (an ``EXISTS`` against tables
versus a dict lookup); the composition of facts is owned here. A fact added to
the rule without an observer on either side fails loudly instead of silently
diverging.

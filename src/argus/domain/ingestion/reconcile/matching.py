"""Deciding which observations describe the same real-world event.

Pure functions over stored shapes, so the rules are testable without storage.
The rules (lane spec, "Deduplication rules"):

- One event holds at most one live observation per source kind. Two different
  observations from the same source are two different purchases unless the
  source itself linked them (``replaces_external_id``).
- Cross-source joining needs equal amount, known dates within the window, and
  no contradiction in currency, direction, account or card mask. Only a
  *strong* match (known equal currency on the same person-confirmed account)
  links automatically, and only when it is the single candidate.
- Equal amount and date alone never merge anything: weaker or multiple matches
  are surfaced for the person as possible duplicates.

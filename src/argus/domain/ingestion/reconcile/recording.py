"""Recording reviewed imports: preview, accept, reviewed batches, linking.

Canonical writes happen in exactly one place, ``accept``, through
``MoneyService.write`` with an idempotency key derived from the event and the
key that claimed it. The claim stores the reviewed request, so an acceptance
interrupted after the money write committed is completed by replaying that
same request and key, never by a second write under another key. Only errors
the money service raises before writing release the claim.

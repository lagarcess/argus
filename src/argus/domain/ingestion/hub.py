"""Connection lifecycle shared by every connector: list and disconnect.

Connectors register a ``SourceAdapter`` for provider-side revocation. The hub
owns the order that keeps disconnect truthful: try to revoke at the provider,
always delete the stored credential and cursor, then let reconciliation drop
unreviewed evidence. A provider outage cannot keep a credential alive here; it
is reported so the person can also revoke at the provider.

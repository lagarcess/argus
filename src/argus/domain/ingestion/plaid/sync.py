"""``/transactions/sync`` for one connection, safe under retries and races.

Order that keeps evidence and the cursor truthful:

1. Refuse before touching the provider when there is no candidate sink.
2. Take the connection lease; a second webhook or a retried delivery for the
   same Item finds it held and returns ``busy``.
3. Page with ``has_more`` from the cursor the sync started with, renewing the
   lease (held-only ``renew``) before every page. A lease lost meanwhile (a webhook recorded
   ``needs_reauth``, which releases it) stops the sync as ``superseded``. On
   ``TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION`` restart the whole loop from
   that same starting cursor, as Plaid requires (bounded attempts).
4. Hand every page's candidates to the sink in one batch.
5. Only then advance the cursor with ``record_success`` (compare-and-set on the
   starting cursor). A sink failure, ignored candidates or a lost race leave
   the cursor alone, so the same changes are fetched again and the idempotent
   sink absorbs them.

Only a complete update (``has_more`` false) is ever handed over or persisted:
a mid-update cursor is never stored, so a later mutation restart can never
mistake it for the update's starting cursor. If the page cap or the time
bound is reached first, the sync records ``plaid_sync_incomplete`` (status
kept) and hands nothing over.

Provider failures are recorded with an actionable code; ``last_success_at``
and the cursor are never cleared by a failure.

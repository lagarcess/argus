"""Which attachment parts are fetched, and how their bytes are checked.

Only PDF, CSV and common image types declared by the message are fetched, and
only when Gmail reports a size within ``MAX_ATTACHMENT_BYTES``; a larger part
is never downloaded. Fetched bytes must match the declared type's file
signature, are hashed (SHA-256) and measured, and are then dropped: this wave
emits ``Attachment`` references only. Reading statement files belongs to the
document-import path, which does not exist yet; until it does, the reference
lets the person and that future path find the file in Gmail again.

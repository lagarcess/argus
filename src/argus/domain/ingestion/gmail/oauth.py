"""Google OAuth web-server flow for one Gmail mailbox.

``authorize`` returns Google's consent URL: ``gmail.readonly`` only, offline
access (a refresh token), ``prompt=consent``, incremental authorization, PKCE
S256 and a sealed single-use ``state`` bound to the person (see ``state``).

``callback`` redeems the state, exchanges the code with the PKCE verifier,
refuses a grant without ``gmail.readonly`` (granular consent lets a person
untick it), reads the mailbox address with ``users.getProfile`` and then:

- creates the connection (``external_ref`` = keyed digest of the address,
  ``label`` = masked address, refresh token sealed under the new id); or
- for a mailbox this person already connected, replaces that live
  connection's credential (reconnect), keeping its cursor and freshness; or
- for a mailbox another person connected, refuses without revoking anything,
  because revoking would end that person's grant too.

The access token from the exchange is used for the profile read and dropped.

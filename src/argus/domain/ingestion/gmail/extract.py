"""What an email may claim, and the default that claims almost nothing.

``EmailExtractor`` is the seam for a future content extractor. It returns
``EmailFacts``: the contract fields it is willing to assert plus what it is
unsure of. It cannot touch source identity, observation time, the excerpt or
attachments; ``build_candidate`` owns those from the message itself, so no
extractor can relabel where evidence came from.

The shipped ``UnreviewedEmailExtractor`` interprets nothing. Amount, currency,
dates, direction and account stay unresolved for the person to supply in
review. The kind of evidence cannot be known without reading the message, and
the contract has no "unknown" evidence kind, so it uses the most demanding
value, ``transaction`` (every money field must be resolved before acceptance),
and lists ``kind`` as uncertain. Reading content (amounts, due dates,
statement periods) is a separate, measured step that needs founder
authorization: a paid model and a committed scorecard (AGENTS.md
Never-Violate 12).

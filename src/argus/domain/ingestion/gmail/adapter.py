"""The hub's ``SourceAdapter`` for Gmail: provider revocation and cleanup.

``revoke`` posts the refresh token to Google's revocation endpoint, which ends
the grant. A token Google no longer knows (``invalid_token``) is already
revoked, so that counts as success; any other failure raises and the hub
reports it while still deleting the local credential.

``forget`` runs after the local disconnect and deletes the connection's sender
allowlist: it has no use once the mailbox is gone.

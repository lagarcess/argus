"""Question-aware selection for the public research sources drawer.

Provider parsing retains a bounded evidence pool. This module is the one
public selection step: it keeps the pages a typed answer cites, removes
citations that cannot plausibly describe the question's period, keeps one page
per publisher, then applies the drawer cap. Retrieval order is preserved among eligible publishers. It also owns the
date a question is asked on, the date every bound here is read against.

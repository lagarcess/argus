"""Whose records a read or write sees: the person's Personal records or one Business space.

A root row (account, source connection, import event, conversation) stores
``owner_space_id``. Null is Personal; a Business row stores its space id. The
rule lives only here: ``sql_predicate``, ``sql_named_predicate`` and
``sql_named_join_predicate`` for SQL, ``postgrest_scoped`` for PostgREST, and
``holds`` for the in-memory twins. Every scoped reader and writer takes
``scope`` as a required keyword: a caller states which side it means.
